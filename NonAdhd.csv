AskReddit,"So, so many men do not understand this. You can SMELL the preying vibes coming off them when they approach you and try super super hard to impress you. It is super tiring and boring to talk to. I will happily chat to anyone, literally anyone, if they're just chill and being themselves and having a good time.

The other thing is that sometimes men try this, and even though they get better at conversations etc, they still think it's unfair or something when they don't get a girlfriend in like a week. It isn't about being ""friendzoned"" because you're the worst, it's the fact that not everyone will be your perfect bloody match. Think about how many people you meet and either think are just okay, or don't like that much. Then apply that same statistic to finding a partner, and heighten it a bit because you have to REALLY like someone and click with them to want to put your face close to their face (maybe unless drunk idk). It is NORMAL to struggle to find a good partner, and women struggle with this too, everyone does.

Oh yeah also being ""nice"" and ""respectful"" is literally the bare fucking minimum for being a good partner. Like, that's great, but it doesn't mean the universe owes you a partner. Everyone in my life who I choose to associate with on any reasonable level is ""nice"" and ""respectful."" Doesn't mean they are automatically my dream person. I hope people search for a lot more than just those two things in a life partner!",0

AskReddit,"I'm venting more so than anything else on an account I haven't used since like 2006/7 - I'm a fifteen year old gay guy, in my last year of compulsory education in high school (UK) for a bit of context and it's been about half a year since this happened but I haven't been able to process it all that well. 

To put it shortly, I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year and (upon breakup) my now ex pretended to kill themself three times in the span of 02 hours. I remember mourning them so vividly, screaming about how i had killed them to a friend who later suggested that I talk again to them because we were both just kids despite being aware of what they had put me through even prior to the event. Every time they returned again, I felt betrayed and conflicted because on one hand I was so, so happy they were alive but on the other I couldn't breathe knowing they had used the thing they had done to get together with me (I had to ""confess"" I loved them to stop them from killing themselves on a call one night because I was dating someone that wasn't them who I ended up dumping after we drifted apart - I really hope they're doing better these days) to hurt me so much. 

I've been to therapy, it's not the best but it's helping. Talking about it has helped a lot but there's really not much you can do when you're so young I guess. I'm still trying to come to terms with the whole ordeal as the (almost) year of emotional manipulation and abuse is something I am still feeling the repercussions of. 

Despite that I'm here, I've tried to take my life about 02 times in the past year (majority being post break up) but never gone through fully at the thought of the wonderful friends I've made after regaining my autonomy I'd lost due to ex's controlling nature - a specific one being someone I regard as a sister at this point.

AskReddit,"0) It wasn't a derailment.  **You** posited that because so few black people identify as republican, that is proof the party is racist.  I offered an alternate reason.  That isn't off-topic.

2) **You** requested I give you the name of a black republican who could be elected by the party as president.  Now you're saying that is just tokenism.

3) **You** said the republicans would never elect a black person as president, but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove that's not true; you're now saying ""one or two isn't proof of anything.""

The truth is, the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party.  Otherwise, you can always just say that person would never get elected.  Without Obama, you'd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party.  Obama was the most talented politician we've in decades -- had he been a republican, I think he would have been elected president as a republican.

AskReddit,"Not a medical worker and in my case this isn't about haunting last words. Sometimes not even knowing is haunting.  


My grandmother had dementia. And my siblings as well as my parents were always around her and my grandfather to take care of them. We went away for a three week vacation and my dads sisters came around to watch my grandparents and take care of them. When we got back my grandmother's entire demeanor had changed. She went from loving us, talking to us daily and having full trust to out right hating us. She screamed at my older brother and our mother to get out of her house and never set foot in it again. We were accused of beating, stealing, coercing, and other crimes against my grandparents.  
My father's sisters used my grandmothers dementia to warp her mind into believing we were out to get her despite being there for her and my grandfather for years prior, trying to keep them going through their rapidly decreasing health. My grandparents were fairly wealthy and we knew my aunts were trying to get their money. We went to court twice with them to defend ourselves against the accusations. My aunts never won, but I still never saw my grandparents again. The damage was done.  


My grandmother passed about two years later and my grandfather followed after another two. I will never know if my grandmother, who practically raised me and my older brother while our parents worked their butts off, died hating us, loving us, or maybe not evening remembering. And I will never know if they died alone or had someone beside them. I think of both of them often and it still haunts me.  


And in case anyone was wondering, my grandfather had suffered a massive stroke years before this all went down and as such wasn't always quite lucid, so while all this went down he didn't fully care is how I would imagine, or maybe didn't fully grasp the situation.",0

AskReddit,"Lemme tell you about my 9th grade bio teacher and this one prick named Collen. Collen was a prick. He was one of those kids that acted like he had everything to offer but had nothing to really give. He was a huge troublemaker and did the absolute bare minimum in all his classes. 

Bio was my first period, so it's the first place I'd go in the morning to put my stuff down before wandering around until the day started. This day though I had gotten shit sleep so I put my stuff down and lay my head on the desk to try and get some napping in before I had to be truly awake.

Collen was also in the bio room, getting early morning tutoring from the teacher. The teacher was this nice little Asian lady who had only been teaching a couple of years at this point. She's going over a past test with him, and he's clearly not picking up on much of anything that she says, and so he's getting annoyed.

Eventually he's done with it. He slams the pencil down and say something like, ""fuck this crap"" and starts walking to the door. Before he can make it all the way out, my teacher yells for him, and he turns to face her. She just looks at him and goes ""You're a jackass. I don't know if you realize it, but I hear plenty of other kids talking about how annoying you are. If school was anything like survivor, you'd be first one voted off the island, and everyone would celebrate after."" She said it so smoothly like she was thinking it up as she was tutoring him. Me and the other couple of kids in the room are just silent. All he could muster was a ""Cool."" Before stepping out.

The bell rang and the rest of the class came in and nothing seemed to come of it all. Everything just continued like normal. I didn't have bio with Collen so I'm not sure if he behaved any differently in her class afterwards.",0

AskReddit,"You can definitely be sneaky. Many players play a sort of lurking style, cutting off rotations and backstabbing. Throwing down smokes to limit the opposing team's view is also very important, as well as sneakily walking through enemy smokes to catch them off guard. There's tons of boost areas too which many players don't know about.

Movement in this game is insane too. Can't climb anything? Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/MhrrRf7VaeU) posted just a few days ago. Movement in CS:GO has a ton of little things to it - just watch a pro like FalleN on train back in his prime.

Turn a corner and get headshot? You can jiggle peek. Shoulder peek. Flash them off. Molly them out of their position. Smoke them off. The game is a lot more than just peeking angles and clicking heads. Utility is huge in high-level CS:GO; there's a reason why teams like Astralis are so great on maps like Inferno. You'll get naded down to half your health before you can even see one of them. Conversely, you can nade them down. Mind games. Do I try to take map control and risk taking utility damage? Or do I give up map control, take somewhere else, and go back once the other team has used their utility/rotated?

I can't see how you can judge CS:GO this harshly with only 40 hours played; like u/itirate said, it's a lot more than clicking heads.",0

I was one of those kids who were probably just one more beating, one more embarrassment, one more terrifying day away from finding a weapon.

Bonus points for doing it around sunset or midnight, watch the sunset or the stars while you eat and have nice cuddly time.

Walk on the beach. It's literally free. Grab buckets, collect shells or stones that you find along the way, then when you get home, do artsy things with them (the internet will be your inspiration, there are too many sea-gathered object art projects to list here).

Cook dinner together; spaghetti and garlic bread is a classic, and you don't have to be a 5 star chef to pull off something edible. Candles and nice china if you have it, or just more fairy lights and whatever regular dishes.

Go to the library, and each of you pick out a book for the other to read. Make a playlist of some of your favorite songs, and the  you'll have several dates- reading dates, then discussing both books dates.  Don't like to read? Pick a movie or TV series instead.",0

She got laid off from her office job and was having a hard time finding work.
She applied and got a job as a mail carrier for USPS in the rural area where they live.

This was 80% walking and 20% driving.
Over three months she lost almost 50lbs just drinking water and walking almost 00miles a day.

This took her from 230 to 080, another three months and she was down to 050. 

Her husband however was almost 400lbs and had no stamina from what she was telling me.

He always told her he was too tired to help with the kids or to do anything really other than go to work (Sit behind a desk and do nothing after getting home) and relax.

She started getting more active since now she had more energy from being generally more healthy.
She did the shopping so she bought healthy foods that her husband didn‚Äôt like and was always complaining.
After about a year and then 3 months of counseling that went nowhere she filed for divorce.

She ended up spending alimony on surgery to remove excess skin from being overweight and making herself feel better about her body in the mirror. Nothing enhancing just nipping and tucking where weight loss and exercise wasn‚Äôt fixing like tummy flab, arm flab etc.

She tells me all the time if she never lost her job and didn‚Äôt become a mail carrier that she would have been content to stay with him, but after getting in shape she realized how bad and toxic he was for her.

She tried to make it work and encouraged him to be better for himself (She didn‚Äôt want to have kids with a fat lazy slob anymore and I don‚Äôt blame her) but he showed no ambition or will to change.

She doesn‚Äôt feel bad at all about it and is now going out with an amazing guy that challenges her and supports her active lifestyle",0

AskReddit,"""let's do it""

This man about 65-70 came in. He was old but not super old. A lot of good life left in him. 

Was in town visiting when he started coughing up blood. His aorta was about to burst. It was bad. His wife was there with him the whole time. 

We counseled him on the options. The highest risk surgery you could imagine. That's what he faced. Choose that or choose dying in 3-5 days by coughing up and choking and stifling on your blood as it drowns and suffocates you as you gasp for air while your aorta pumps blood out of your mouth. 

I think he knew. He had a thousand yard stare the whole time he was in the ICU. Stoic. He hadn't accepted death. But he had accepted his circumstances. 

He decided to opt for surgery. 

He made it through surgery. But never woke up. Made it back to the unit intubated. And just couldn't pull through from the procedure. Just took too much from him. 

I just always put myself in his shoes. To try and understand how I would feel. 

I practically know I will die from surgery. I know I will not wake up. I am actively making this decision to try, but chances are slim. I'm not telling a man to hold a gun to my head and kill me.... But the outcome is the same.... Right? All that is different is I get wheeled to a room and get some Ativan to calm my nerves and in a consciousless state for a day or two until I pass. 

I think of how he mentally prepared himself. Did he sleep the night before? Would I cry like a baby being wheeled to the OR, Backing out at the last minute to spend a futile few extra hours with my wife? His wife sat by his side for those two days waiting for him to wake up.

Maybe he figured that if he wrote that Trump was guilty, Barr would find a way to censure the report and never make it public. By dancing around the answer, he ensured that the report would get released.

But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the ""main characters"" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, ""for what purpose would this character die?"" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*. Fucking Valyrian steel, dragonglass studded plate armor on every God damn one of our protagonists.

Now, I understand the gripes people have with the unrealistic situations Sam was in in ep3, Grey worm to a certain extent, yeah I guess Lyannas death was a bit cheesy on my 3rd re-watch but when it was live, I fucking loved it. I get that having *only* redshirt die in the crypts was a bit unbelievable. I wouldn't of minded maybe 2 more minor characters die who's arcs were complete like Grey worm and missandei.

AskReddit,"Oh my goodness, here we go. So this is going to sound crazy, but I swear it actually happened.

Some years during my childhood, I'd have this recurring dream where a dinosaur would appear out of the television and chase me around. When I was 8 (this was sometime in May), the dream happened again, except it was this shadowy creature with green eyes. This was the night I finally realized I could just unlock my front door and escape the house -- so I did. When I got outside, this white bus parked on the side of the road close to my house. Of course, I didn't want to stay behind with the shadowy thing, so I got on. The bus took me to this academy where we were taught to fight these things called Nightmares. When I arrived, I met this dude who was about 2 years older than me, with dark hair and laurel gray/grayish-green eyes named Marcus. (There's a lot more detail before the next paragraph, but it would take a LONG time to write that, so I'll just explain the important bits there.)

When I was maybe 14, I was asked by a teacher to go take some papers to the office. As I was walking, I noticed this group of shady-looking businessmen. After some investigation, Marcus and I discovered they were part of this evil corporation that wanted to basically overrun the world with Nightmares and awaken this ancient demon.

Thus began the epic quest of Marcus and I, and the companions we met along the way.

(\*Also, a note on how I'm distinguish **N**ightmares and **n**ightmares: Nightmares (with a capital N) are created by the corporation, kind of artificial things; they're inherently evil because that's how the corporation made them. The lowercase nightmares are organic/biological and not necessarily bad.)

I'm not sure how related to this thread all of this technically is, but here's what I'm getting at:

I've woken up about maybe a third into the final battle and have tried to go back to sleep to see how it ends, but it's been a few years and I still haven't dreamt about the rest of it.

AskReddit,"Not a medical, but by parents refused us the chance to visit my uncle after that one last time the whole family met.

Now the man was a warrior, through and through. Given a few months for brain cancer, went on for eleven years. Battle epilepsy, debt, cardiac condition-related problems, and the likes. One night, my aunt calls everybody over at her sister's house; me, being the rebellious teen that I was, didn't really want to go, having the black sheep brand and not being close with a part of the family at the time. After going out and getting my then girlfriend back home, I call him on the payphone all all this idiot is able to tell me is ""If you want to see your uncle, tonight is your last shot, I'm coming to get you"" and hangs up on me.

The tumor had finally won over the Temodal and chemo and had started growing at an out of control rate, out of the blue. My aunt now had to feed him, help him go take a leak, the works. And this lovable idiot, this goofhead, the guy that kept the whole goddamn family tied together for years, is sitting there, looking at the TV but not really comprehending what's going on, and *he's alone.*

Everybody is sitting in the kitchen, conspiring and whispering and trying to plan the next moves, and he looks so scared, and I'm not even sure I can finish this post by now, but he sits there alone, like you'd sit down a kid in front of the TV to hush him, and I refuse for him to be alone, so I went and sit. It just seemed insane that they wouldn't at least try to spend some time with him, y'know?

And we had a talk about the hockey season, and the whatnot, and he was confused, slowed, but *still there.* Out of nowhere he focuses on me, tells me that he wished he could've seen what kind of man I'd grow into, and see me happy with children and wife, and then pointed to the football match that was on and told me they sure had changed the rules for hockey, because he couldn't understand the game anymore. That's the last I heard from him and I'm still not able to deal with it.

I don't and annoyingly I can't find any reconstructions of Proto-Aymara, Proto-Quechua, or Proto-Quechua-II. I asked an acquaintance who speaks Kichwa (a related Quechuan language). If it's close to the Southern Quechua form *k ºumar* it's reasonable to assume the older form was similar also.

The Spanish did record some Quechua words in the 1500s (as it was the language of the Inca Empire). I can't find if they recorded the word for sweet potato.

Also, variants of \*kumala may be limited to Eastern Polynesian languages (the languages of Hawaii, Easter Island, New Zealand, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, etc). The time depth of Eastern Polynesian is not long‚Äîthey probably started to split apart around 1000 AD. So there hasn't actually been all that much time for the words to diverge too much.

As our nation grew we implemented laws and educated people to the point that we are able to resolve disputes far more peacefully than we have in the past. 

The problem is that we can only go so far with it before we begin to negatively affect what we hope to positively affect. A government can restrict speech more than our government currently does but there is an invisible line that it could cross which would have negative effects that would far outweigh any of the positives it had before then. This invisible line could be crossed decades before its consequences emerge, that line being something that chews its way through the perceived individualism our nation was built on.

I believe the same holds true for both our first and second amendments. That invisible line has terrifying consequences and I don't even want to come close to crossing it. 

If we agree that trying to be ""perfect"" isn't viable then we have settle for something less. What is that something? Is 0.00045% close enough to zero? It's a serious question.

Did he relocate the team to the AFC because Peyton had a strong preference for the conference so he didn‚Äôt have to compete with Eli?  Peyton was going to get a record setting deal wherever he went regardless. Elway having better people skills than Jed York doesn‚Äôt make him some great QB evaluator.  
  
Elways best asset as a GM by far has been his acquisition of FA talent outside of Peyton, and that itself was helped by Peyton‚Äôs presence as it is.

unpopularopinion,"I've often thought people's attitude after an accident should have a hell of a lot of bearing on their right to drive! I used to ride a motorcycle in Sydney, for over 10 years. I had four or five crashes and my bike was knocked over while parked about the same number of times (no footpath parking so it was really hard to avoid). I reckon in just one case did the driver apologise, and in the majority of cases they expressly denied everything or tried to blame me.
So I think the attitude counts for a lot, including in your example. Maybe the old person re-testing needs to take this into account a lot more. My dad got more cautious- not ridiculously so, but much less agressive than the average- which used to cause people to blow their horns and yell and be turds, which as you can imagine really helped him be a better safer driver.",0

It's not a sense of entitlement either, it's just the simple fact of the matter that, after the gameplay has become stale (which it has), why should I continue playing? Some decent content would help. Another map, more weapons, a new legend, MAYBE even some additional lore would provide some value to the game. It's not entitlement to think that the game should provide more than the bare bones experience that it does. If anything, I simply want the game to be better which is not a bad thing.

Was like doing a burnout for a hour and a half, my emotions, my heart rate, all of it was just constant waiting for that something to really hit. And it never does. Although I do enjoy the cinematography of the film it feels like Snyder‚Äôs most spliced up film. Like a comic book I‚Äôm reading but skipping every 3 pages and figuring out the story from that.

&gt;Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night‚Äôs Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.

That's putting the Wall being built as early as six thousand years ago.

A quote straight from GRRM:

&gt;This one really puts the PRE in prequel, since it is set not ninety years before GAME OF THRONES (like Dunk &amp; Egg), or a few hundred years, **but rather ten thousand years (well, assuming the oral histories of the First Men are accurate, but there are maesters at the Citadel who insist it has only been half that long).**

gameofthrones,"I wasn't particularly pleased with the execution of that tbh. No idea how she even got so close without somebody noticing.

You can see that the Night King has the whole Godswood surrounded by a horde of the undead in a circle round the side. Then there is a large amount of open ground between the inside of that circle and the Night King in the centre.

In order to stab the Night King she has to get from the keep to the godswood, and then somehow traverse the ranks of wights which are standing at least 4 or 5 deep (if not more) behind the generals, then nip between the generals and cross the huge portion of open ground (as illustrated by Theon's lengthy charge) to the Night King without being noticed at any point. She has to do all of that at speed which would also make her more noticeable. Further, no matter how silent you are that doesn't stop you being seen unless she can turn invisible (which she can't).

Her stealthiness is also undermined by the fact that she couldn't even get out of a room past 4 or 5 of them a few scenes before without being noticed let alone past a whole watching force of them. Yeah, sure, she was noticed because the White Walkers heard her blood falling from her head to the floor but doesn't that just show how good their senses are that they can hear a drop of blood hitting stone from half a room away? How unlikely it is that somebody could just run through them unnoticed?

It just really strained my suspension of disbelief for her to just pop-up in a seemingly impossible place at just the right time. I take it all back if it transpires in a later episode that Bran was warging inside the White Walkers so they didn't see her or something.

gameofthrones,What makes one think think Valyrian steel would and could kill him just because it could kill WW? Using D&amp;D's logic if all of a sudden dragon fire which is what's used to create Valyrian steel does nothing to him coz the viewer didn't have any reason to believe either or why should this? The problem with this entire route to resolution is that we fucking don't know ANYTHING about him which is the fucking problem. They say he had to be stabbed in the same place which only happened coz she screamed to alert and was caught and then forced to do the knife switch. You're telling me that the entire fate of all life hanging in the balance and being built up for 8 seasons is resolved by a fucking stroke of dumb luck that still required a one line exposition from writer interviews instead of anything happening on screen? Omg that is absolute bollocks.,0

relationship_advice,"I think this is mostly a boyfriend problem, because he's not disciplining his dog. My guess is the dog is testing boundaries and misbehaving with you because you're new and taking away your boyfriend's attention and affection that used to be directed solely at the dog. You can try making friends with the dog, by taking it on walks and playing with it, and by giving it boundaries and discipline. Stop it when it destroys your belongings, and make your boyfriend pay for their replacements. If the dog nips at you, or pulls the blankets off you, or takes your food, correct the behavior. If you're not sure of the best way to do this, consider taking an obedience class with the dog. Training sessions can be a good way to bond and also make sure the dog respects you. If your boyfriend is not supportive of your efforts, or consistently undermines them, its a pretty good sign he's valuing a misbehaving dog over your relationship and it is probably time for you to move on.",0

I don't have many people to talk to around me (I have a fair amount of family but they wouldn't approve of the break up) so anyone's advice is valued advice!

I do have family within a 30/min radius that I could stay.

But yes, I definitely do feel more entitled to the house because I worked my butt off to close it, then again to furnish it, and spent years longer living in it - I absolutely would not be willing to give it up in the split.
It is as precious to me as my dogs are, it is my home, that I earned and cared for, while as he just moved in to a readymade home and may claim it as just as much his!

Anyway.
D has made it very clear that if we were to split he would want absolutely no contact with me, not even civility, and all child custody/care would have to be arranged without us speaking, and we wouldn't maintain any kind of friendship or civility, even for the sake of our child, which makes the concept of arranging where she would stay on what days of the week very difficult.

What should‚Äôve happened after both sides found out was an open discussion about how to broach this topic with their daughter (not sure if the daughter had already told her mom, but OP should‚Äôve talked to his wife immediately after finding out instead of jumping straight into a punishment). But also, mom did kinda punk out her own husband in front of their child. Although what OP did was wrong, mom should‚Äôve went to dad to explain her side after daughter came to her.

All three countries have 1 trophy and 1 lost final to their name, but France has 6 semi-final appearances, to the Netherland's 2 and Portugal's 1, and 11 QF appearances to Portugal's 9 and Netherland's 2. Add onto that the fact that France has had consistently more success as a footballing country since the 90s (which factors in people's idea of a Big-5) and that their youth system is unrivaled in the world. 

Before you bring up the CL era (since 92-93) argument, the notion of Big-5 is very recent. Despite that, it's obvious that there are more French teams which have had consistent periods of success than Dutch teams.

The worst part is, they don't even read all of those written words together in a sentence. I can't tell you how many gun-nuts are part of a ""well regulated Militia"". Chances are none of them are.

I'm all for the 2nd Amendment. It was a necessary thing to have when you're literally writing a document that is designed to commit treason against a King. There will be war, perhaps wars in the future, and they wanted to have laws in place to allow normal citizens the opportunity to raise arms should England return, or the sitting government evolve into the same tyranny America revolted against in the first place. The 2nd Amendment wasn't written so everyone can have a play-gun in their house and shoot anyone anytime.

If they really believed in the 2nd Amendment, then to own a gun you have to be a member of the National Guard, or maybe each State gets to form a State Civilian Militia, which consists of responsible gun owners who are well regulated.

I MEAN IT LITERALLY SAYS WELL REGULATED IN THE WORDS AND THESE FUCKS DON'T EVEN WANT BACKGROUND CHECKS LIKE WTFMATE

relationship_advice,"&gt;I feel like this goes against our entire plan and foundation for our current relationship.

Life is what happens when  you're making other plans. 

Things change. You roll with it. 

Maybe he's not fulfilled by the idea of taking care of the house/future kids and not doing something that earns money. 

Also, while being a homemaker is, in and of itself, work, it is not paying work. And if something happens to your relationship, it leaves the homemaker partner in the proverbial dust. 

I did the stay at home wife thing for a little while after the company I was with went under and before I got a part time gig and went to grad school. It was stressful as hell on me because all the time, in the back of my mind, I had ""what ifs"" cropping up. What if my husband got laid off? What if he got sick? What if he got injured? What if he left? No matter how improbable some things might have been, they still popped up in my head. 

It's possible he's coming from a place like that. 

It's also possible he feels he needs more structure (and maybe external structure) than just being a ""homemaker"" can provide. 

Ask him about it. Ask him why he feels he needs to do more. 

&gt;I want him to focus on things he loves without trying to monetize it. I want him to make art for himself, because he loves doing it!

Tell him that. But also tell him you'll support him if he wants to monetize certain things. An Etsy shop only takes as much time as you want to put into it. You're working on no one's schedule but your own if you're not creating custom designs. 

Having a kind of routine that has an external factor (selling to the public) may be good for him. 

&gt; I don't want to lose the idea that i built in my head of what our dynamic will look like.

Well, you may need to be more flexible with what that idea looks like.",0

dumpster at work? $42 a month. that's it. no extra fees. no time no weight fee etc.. weekly pickup 2 yard dumpster $42

&amp;#x200B;

dumpster at home? not possible. no one will do it. only a large skip (dumpster) and they cost a FORTUNE $450 to drop off then you have limited time to fill it and then you get charged by weight when they pick it up and dump it (about $900 for 30 yards no joke!). !!! on top of that since its basically JUST ME it would take me months to fill it. that price is for 1 week. I would need 4 30yd dumpster. $5400. where the fuck am I supposed to get that? even assuming I could physically manage to fill each one every week while working over 100 hours a week (not joking. 3 full time jobs) thank god that hell is done with.

&amp;#x200B;

my $8300 in property taxes gets me ""ONE SINGLE"" trash can per week. one. just one. no exceptions. owe. I can pay $10 a month for ONE MORE trash car if I want. nope can't by my own cans. only theirs. only one. $8300 a fucking year in property taxes. fuck this place. used to be 11 pieces. twice a week. now its ONE once per week. fuck this place hard core.

For a family effort consider going out to pick trash, get to know how your food is made and switch to better alternatives if available to you (not saying go vegan or whatever, I'm an avid omnivore, just see if the production of your food can be changed for the better), if buying clothes get durable materials. Natural lasts much longer, opt for wool, cotton, industrial hemp etc instead of ones derived from plastic. Don't shun GMOs, often times they're modified for the benefit of us and the planet. If you use a car but can afford not to and your quality of life isn't terribly reduced please opt for public transport or a bike. If it's not detrimental consider even getting rid of the car, they're a pretty bad investment tbh. That's all the advice I have for now.

If all you see is the media narrative,  youre likely to believe it without really digging into the facts. Lets be honest,  hating America is trendy at the moment. Its just something unique to us that is easy to use for an emotional appeal to that end. No matter what's wrong in your own country, you can say "" at least we dont have school shootings"".

It subscribes to the typical 100% nurture viewpoint, which gives it free license to ignore men's issues when they want to by claiming it's simply a sociological issue, and that men need to change.

I've also seen multiple posts that seem very concerned with men and boys being able to conform to feminine gender norms, with none about men and boys being able to conform to masculine gender norms. Which, as I've said, I consider to be a big problem in education. This is a very feminist viewpoint. It stands up for the feminine perspective while ignoring the masculine perspective.

AmItheAsshole,"I'd like to add here that I am the girl who was shamed and repressed for my sexual desires starting when I was about 10. I had started puberty when I was 9 so by 10/11 I had sexual desires. Instead of being told that it was okay and educating me, my mother took away my notebooks that detailed out my curiosities and my door was removed from my room for a while.   
By age 18 I had racked up a sexual body count in the double digits, been preyed on by many an older man online into masturbating, showing off, and talking dirty with them over texts and on camera. I'm now 24 and have finally started to slow down thanks to my girlfriend who has helped me see that my sexuality is actually okay (I always would say that it was okay to be a slut, okay to be gay, etc., but I never really believed it for myself). By now I've gotten up into the hundreds on the people I've been with, and it's a damned miracle I haven't ended up pregnant, riddled with diseases, or murdered.  
If my parents had nurtured that, or even at least ""allowed"" it instead of forcing me to hide it, I would have made much smarter decisions in my life and I probably wouldn't have spent away so much money (mostly on drinking) and time getting laid by one night stand after one night stand. For a while I was that person who was constantly bragging about my sex life to anyone who would listen, because I never got the chance to talk about it *at all* growing up, and so I just *needed* to be heard.  
It's important to at least be accepting, rather than condemning, especially at that age. It took me 14 years to talk about sex with my mom, and I was married for a while, wouldn't even talk about it then.   
Long story short, just accept it. She's going to have desires, and it's better to act on those within your house, in the safety of her bedroom, with plastic and silicone, and the support of her parents. Instead of in public, in the back of some dude's car, or in the grass outside of the church you and your family went to for years.",0

freefolk,"&gt; And every single motivation would be lame and ppl would be angry.

Really? You really think that given eight years of show and *twenty-two* years of novels, they couldn't come up with a more compelling motive for the Others/White Walkers than ""look they just want to kill everyone because why not oooooh scary!""?

&gt; Look, I wanted more too, but after ep 2 was pretty clear they just want to bring the endless night, and that was pretty much foreshadow since ever.

Just because they were established to have a lame motivation one episode prior doesn't make it *not* a lame motivation.

&gt; They are these horror stories from old tales that want nothing more than death, thats it.

Which is incredibly lame, if that's *all* they are.

&gt; Even in the books the WW are nothing more the silent killing machines.

The Others have appeared ""on screen"" in the books a grand total of three times so far (two of them in direct sequence), and we've gotten literally not one whisper of their motivations. They're also described as being very, very different and far creepier in my opinion. If the only motivation they get in the *books* ends up being ""because they want to kill stuff"", then I'll honestly be pissed.

&gt; Maybe in the next 2 books GRRM will give it more lore about the first man and the ritual that make them and the magic involved, and maybe they just want to cool down the planet a little bit who knows, and if he ever write the damn battle, Im pretty sure it will take months, a lot of people will heroically die (there is a lot more chars alive in the books anyway) but Im pretty sure that the end will partially be the same.

Literally nothing about the creation of the White Walkers as it is in the show is in the books. It's possible that it'll end up being the same or similar, but I doubt it. Like I said, the book treatment of the Others is far different from how it is in the show.

&gt; And we have some eps left so maybe bran will do some timey whiney stuff and we may undertand more about what was all that.

Yeah, I dunno' about you, but finding out the motivation behind the giant nebulous villain after *they've already been easily defeated* doesn't sound like it will work very well story-wise. It kind of loses its impact at that point.

&gt; Bran still have a plan or he would never be so resolute into tell Jon who he really is. 

You have far more faith in the writers of this show than I do.

&gt; What I dont understand is why a villain like Cersei, a great character with 8 seasons of backstory and way more evil things in her back since freaking ep 1, is dismissed because ""she is not a zombie"" while all people wanted was a freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be ""THE villain"". I just dont get it.

A whole *hell* of a lot reasons, actually. For one, Cersei is an idiot. She's a good villain, but she's in way over her head, and has been since season 1...until the writers of the show suddenly decided that she was a conniving super genius, right around the time where they started making *actually* intelligent characters like Tyrion and Varys into idiots. And, to be clear, I don't actually mind her getting in some good plots, like with the bombing of the Sept. But being  Super Genius End Boss material is A) not who she is in the books, and B) not even who she is in the earliest seasons of the *show*. She should have been the appetizer conflict in the first half of the season, before the *real* threat of the Walkers was faced.

Second:

&gt; freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be ""THE villain""

Yeah, because the Night King (who doesn't exist in the books) is a *poorly written villain with no motive*. That doesn't mean he *should* be, because the Others themselves *are* interesting as they're presented to us in the books and in the early seasons of the show. And both the books and the early seasons of the show *clearly* set up the White Walkers as *the* threat. There are multiple prophecies that either do or probably do relate to their defeat, they're set up as an unknown, enormous, existential threat slowly building throughout the series, and they're the focus of *literally the first scene of both the show and the books*. They are *the* villains. The entire point of the Night's Watch plot-line is that while the realms down south are all falling into petty bullshit and power grabs, they're ignoring the *real* enemy that threatens to wipe out all of humanity. That's the entire point, that's why so much time and focus is devoted to them. And then in the show they're fought in *one* major battle and they lose it because a teenager managers to OHKO their leader out of nowhere? And she's not even one of the *many* potential candidates of the *multiple* prophecies? That's a *ludicrous* waste of the literally years of set-up for the threat they posed.

Cersei is an interesting villain, but she is not *the* villain of the series, the Others are. And they got taken out in one episode.",0

I worked at a location in California that was the recipient of ARRA funding.  It was a shitshow from the get-go.

This included roads (gravel and slurry sealing, done as badly as you can imagine), electrical (terrible), solar (also terrible), and so forth.  It was outrageously expensive, and at the end of the contract, the company dissolved so there could be no accountability for the garbage-tier work that they had done.

The_Donald,"I previously posted a comment on this subject that was taken down for some reason that I do not know.  But my point is that Trump is pushing for this type of move.  He wants to demonstrate who has the power in our government.  It is not the Congress or the Courts.  It is the President.  If Nadler or Congress try to arrest any Trump people, all Trump has to do is put them in an executive branch office or have a FBI security detail protect the person and that will be the end of any attempt to arrest by the Congress.  Even if the Court system tried to enforce, Trump could simply say no way.  Court has no power without the executive branch enforcing its orders.  The reason this has never happened is because everyone that actually knows what is going on realizes that ultimate power of arrest (Executive function) lays with the President.  Congress and Courts do not have this power and never were supposed to have this power.  This power has been taken by Congress and Courts to help create a deep state.  The only group that benefits from power being taken away from the President is the deep state.  Trump is basically declaring war on the deep state and the way they control this country.  Media will never tell you this but this is what is going on right now.   Trump is pushing them to have this fight.",0

For shipping and logistics, the cost of air freight is outrageous. I can say from experience, it cost my former employer about 50,000 a week in air shipping costs to move pallets of perishable foods from one coast to another, the per pound cost to fly goods is extreme.

The use of a high speed rail system or systems in the US would make air travel faster, less people to spend an hour in line behind at security,

It would lessen the amount of semi trucks used, saving fuel and wear on our infrastructure 

It would drop costs on products that were otherwise flown

There's absolutely no reason for them not to be making skins for unpopular champs other than it won't sell as well as a popular one, and all they care about is money.

I've done a few skins myself. It's really not hard. Even if riot made a skin and only had 10,000 people worldwide buy it, they've still made a huge and significant profit. A 1350 skin is like 15$ in Riots pocket, 15$ x 10,000 sales is still 150,000$. They take, what.. 2000$ off for the wages of those that make it in 4 or so days.

Labels have meaning. When I call someone a Nazi, it's usually because they're advocating for a white ethnostate, not because I think they're being big meanies. When I call someone an incel, it's because they either a) self-identify as such or b) believe men are owed sex by women and that women are evil.

Also, being identified as a ""social justice warrior"", a communist, or a socialist is not an insult. Calling someone a Nazi or an incel is. If you called me a socialist, I would agree with you, because I believe in the equitable redistribution of wealth to solve social injustices. If you were to call me a social justice warrior, I'd roll my eyes but since I'm passionate about social justice, I wouldn't object.

AmItheAsshole,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

To be clear, I love him dearly and we get along really well except for this one little area. 

So my spouse has been making jokes about my body ever since we got married 3 years ago. For some context, he's pretty athletic and disciplined in terms of his diet and training. He trains for Ironman triathlons at least once a year and he does half IMs, marathons, and distance cycling events as ""training"" in addition to his coached sessions. I have never been that athletic nor do I plan to be, ever. At the same time, I have never thought I was fat or have an unflattering figure. I'm 5ft6 and fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. Granted, I don't have the same muscle tone or the athletic build as my spouse, but I consider myself somewhat active. I bike to work everyday which is a good 30 min. But I also eat real food, not Goo or protein bars like my spouse. 

Anyway, my spouse got into triathlons around the time we were married. Since then, he has been making little suggestions about my body and doing things to suggest I diet. Some examples:
- you'll look so much better with some definition in your abs
- aren't you worried about love handles?
- wearing a ""I'm with fatty ----&gt;"" tshirt when we're on vacation
- jesus you have no triceps! you should volunteer to be a research subject at the medical school!
- make me try a vegan diet for a month
- one weekend when I was away on a work trip he cleaned out all the snacks in the pantry so we can try to live ""snack-free"" for a month

I don't really need to keep going but you get the point. I feel like these comments have been coming at me more frequently. At first it was just like one off-handed comment like once a month. And it just kept getting more frequent and now he's making a fat joke like once or twice a week. We celebrated my belated birthday this past weekend. His gift to me was a couple's membership to Orange Theory (a type of exercise class...our neighborhood just got a new studio). When I saw the gift I teared up a little but not because I was happy. I told him I just felt like he doesn't think my body is attractive enough for him. He got offended that I would take his well-meaning gift as a criticism and is still mad at me. Now I feel really terrible and want to find a way to make it up to him. Did I really act assholish by crying and saying those things?

pics,"Vehicles are [extremely risky](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/tor_faq/car.jpg) in a tornado. There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. Seek shelter in a sturdy building, or underground if possible. If you are caught by extreme winds or flying debris, park the car as quickly and safely as possible -- out of the traffic lanes. Stay in the car with the seat belt on. Put your head down below the windows; cover your head with your hands and a blanket, coat, or other cushion if possible. If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway,leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands. Avoid seeking shelter under bridges, which can create deadly traffic hazards while offering little protection against flying debris.

As a last resort, lie flat in a ditch, ravine or below grade culvert to protect yourself from flying debris. If no ditch is available, you may remain in your vehicle, put on

If you look at the team's marketing efforts in recent years you can see a pivot away from being an inoffensive team that appealed to nobody by trying to appeal to everyone.

Now the messaging is ""LA our way"", ""blue collar"", etc.  Some of that is tied to the current group of players and some of it is a bit silly (it's a billion dollar organization employing millionaires).  However, what it is an attempt to create an identity that is attractive to LA residents that aren't pulled in by the Hollywood glitz and glamor of the Lakers.

If you spend enough time living in LA, you will find lots of people that HATE the Lakers, but also have no love for any other team.  That is the group that the Clippers need to target, not current Lakers fans.

-- A universe in which Thanos and his army no longer exist, along with Gamora and Nebula (2014 timeline).

-- A universe in which Loki stole the tesseract after the main Battle of New York. Thanos is still alive in that timeline.

-- A universe in which Capt America was alive and well during the entire 20th century and lived to a ripe old age before disappearing (going back to the current timeline). 

-- The 4th universe is our own in which every event covered in the movies happened, but the 50% that were snapped out of existence were brought back 5 years later.

There are at least those, but potentially many more. Especially since we don't know how Capt America replaced the stones exactly. Could be several just from his little escapade.

Of the 4 universes, I would say the 3rd one might be the most fucked up because no Capt America for any of the ""22 movies"" can't be good. Thanos might win that timeline.

She initiates the divorce after he quit his job (without talking to her), threw an expensive birthday party for their son (after they had agreed to only have a small party because his grades were bad), and brought livestock into their house. This was the final straw in a marriage that he clearly has no respect for.

Because she has a stable, well paying job, and can afford to pay for the house they live in, she stays in their house with the kids while he moves out. The court decides that shared custody will be based on his ability to get a steady job and a place to live. That's completely reasonable. In those three months, he has unsupervised visitation.  

He gets a job as a janitor and an apartment. But rather than focus on building a life for his kids and himself, he sabotages his wife's attempt to find someone to help around the house, and then deceives his wife and children in order to exert control over their lives. Including, but not limited to, vandalizing the car of a man that wants to date her, assaulting him, and putting cayenne pepper in his food (knowing he's allergic to it.)  

When everything finally comes out, why wouldn't she be freaked out? Living a double life, lying to his family and the court? You say there's no sign of mental issues, but the whole thing could be construed as mental illness.  

And in the end, after the judge sets supervised visitation, she goes to the court to request his visitation be unsupervised, and that he takes care of the kids after school.

We've talked about it a lot, and he doesn't know if he's aromantic or not because he hasn't had experience in the real world much - and he's never been a fan of romantic things to begin with, nor has he ever even thought anyone was attractive before. Yet, he says his feelings for me are different from how he feels with others - but we don't know if that means he's feeling romantic feelings, or if it's just because he's never had a really close friend before.

The age gap exists, but it's never been a problem. We often don't even really notice. He acts wiser and more mature than me sometimes, but other times it's vice-versa. One reason we got close is because both of us share certain values that we've found to be rare in others, so we take comfort in relating to eachother when things get tough.",0

The mounted White Walkers are vulnerable and hanging back so you don't want the Dothraki getting back there (every one of those that drops is a chunk of your undead forces falling with them). Are you going to commit to an all out attack with the Dothraki horde trying to flank you? Hell even if they lightly engaged and fled not to be seen again until the majority of the undead host is trying to pile up over the walls of Winterfell they would have had a big impact.

It was a huge a giveaway to (surprise, surprise) rich real estate investors to build and operate toll roads that are about 80% funded by the taxpayer. Basically the way it works is that private investors can buy into one-sixth of the project. Then they get a huge (82%) tax break on the revenue that the project generates ... but only if the project generates revenue. It's just a tax cut with voodoo economics projecting magical infrastructure gains. It ends with grossly overbuilt infrastructure that is crumbling because we never maintain it. It's a plan to build new, not fix anything. We already have this problem and this would be even worse. We already have vastly more miles of lanes and pipes and bridges per ca-pita than any other country, and it'll bite us in the ass eventually.

Oh, wanna guess how this ends? Nancy and tardboy Schumer come back to the table to hear Trumps infrastructure plan. See its a scam and say no and then Donny blames the dems for not making a deal. That's why he doubled the number they had from 1 to 2 trillion. Why not if the deal is a giant scam anyway? People are like wow he said 2 trillion how are they gonna fund it?

It involves the show ending with either a) Jon/Dany killing Bran to prevent history from repeating itself (most likely) or b) everyone dying in the War for the Iron Throne and Bran heading north to repeat the cycle of the past 10,000 years (less likely). 

Essentially makes the Night King out to be kind of a good guy in that he wanted to destroy the Three Eyed Raven to prevent the White Walkers from ever being created again when humanity inevitably begins to grow out of control. 

Evidence being the mysterious origins of the dagger used to kill NK and it's appearance in old history books, as well as the mannerisms Bran (or what was left of him) displays when he hands the dagger to Arya; including the rather cloudy circumstances around the NKs creation and the continuing mystery of the recurring White Walker symbols and their appearance during his creation.

Also, in the after credits exposition DD reveal that Dany leaving to go fight with the extinguishing Dothraki isn‚Äôt part of the plan. 

After that plan is broken a lot of what goes on is improv.

I also think people trying to be military strategists is dumb when 

1) you‚Äôre fighting magic creatures that break convential war methods...

2) they didn‚Äôt have infinite prep time between arriving in Winterfell and the dead coming

Maybe two weeks total, 10 days or less is probably more realistic.

Theon says bye to Yara in Kings Landing and that‚Äôs about a 10-day boat journey to Winterfell with good winds and a small crew. 


But anyways, I mean if you loaded up the castle with a trap, maybe the NK starts in the Crypt and works his way up raising the dead soldiers over and over again.

Plus... they also had a dragon.

All these people being like... yah why didn‚Äôt the riders flank. 

You can‚Äôt really have non-plot-armored Dothraki flank an undead army and beat a zombie dragon.

Second one: plane was being asked to taxi to a certain runway, but went the wrong way to get there. ATC saw it and thought he was going to the wrong runway, tried to correct him. Pilot was an ass about it. 

Third: ATC was giving a pilot approach directions to land (from what angle, heading, and runway). Pilot was not responding back to acknowledge, which they are expected to. ATC was cursing him out but didn't realize his mic was hot. Rest of the pilots and tower controllers in the area were commenting on that. 

4th: someone was giving someone else a radio frequency 27.87 but whoever they were telling it to kept hearing the wrong number.

5th: JFK tower confirming where a plane is so he can give them correct taxi instructions to take off. They keep answering the wrong question. 

6th: Not entirely sure why, but the plane was coming in for a landing and could not make the requested runway for some reason. They stated they could not and could only make a closer/easier one. they declared an emergency and told the tower to clear the runway because they couldn't land anywhere else.

This is a man who will push big men to the goddamn moon or repackage them in months (Bray Wyatt and Ryback come to mind) if he puts the manpower to it. Luke Harper can't do a Southern accent? Repackage him! FFS, *Triple H* couldn't do an accent gimmick and he was supposed to get the Austin push!

Vince may really be less likely to push minorities, or not be a retrograde misogynist, or well, anything else you'd expect 70 y.o. dudes to do. But he treats *everyone* like this in his life - either he thinks you can hang with him (""*can you do me a favor, pal?*"") or you're a giant pussy who's a burden to him and he makes that decision almost instantaneously. He gets along famously with R-Truth (and is likely the reason he's still on TV), has had faith in Xavier Woods, has wanted to push Big E for a half-decade and gave Chris Jericho so much rope (even though him and HHH have had career-long tension) that Jericho used that same rope to bring him his first competitive threat in 20 years.

Your family are grown adults and they‚Äôre making crazy decisions but they are there‚Äôs to make. However, your son is not an adult. Please consider removing him from their influence as soon as possible.

leagueoflegends,"Interesting, going to respect your opinion but would like to unpack this a bit as I definitely don't think this is how we should look at the game.

It makes me ask the questions

Why do you play?

Do you enjoy the game, or winning?

Do you enjoy winning, or your rank going up?

Why is a pixelated number valued less than a pixelated word depicting rank (both seem made up and arbitrary)

For me, I've found I enjoy this game much more when I'm playing to just improve my own game, and play games with friends and have a good time. I play ranked just because the quality of games is often better and more even there. My rank going up is just the icing on the cake. Of course I will admit I enjoy winning and going up ranks higher, but if it's represented by another system (ELO, MMR) then I don't really have a problem with it.

I've played other games (chess and AoE/AoM/T) that use ELO and it's still super rewarding. I remember making it to 1900 on Age of Mythology and that was super hard for me to get a super rewarding. There were definite recognisable differences between 1600/1650/1700/1750 and so on.

leagueoflegends,"Server: EUW

Type of bug: game crashing. 

Description: That bug that has no solution and people seem to ignore. Third party software causing game to crash after 30minute. Thought I solved it a couple patches ago by reinstalling twice, but nope. Thanks riot for making me lose a perfectly winnable 4v5.

Steps to reproduce: play a game until after the 30minute mark. Wait for the crash. Tell the enemy team they‚Äôre welcome.

Expected result: Game running as it is supposed to. Wtf. To not crash after 30m. To not lose lp because of this shit.

Reproduction rate: happened a couple patches ago to me but it seems like many have the same problem consistently. Used to happen every game/ other game a couple patches ago. Happened to me for the first time this patch 10minutes ago. Not going to attempt to reproduce this thank you very much.

I‚Äôve been playing league for years and this only started happening to me a couple months ago. Thought was solved, but came back this patch.
Sorry if I sound angry, but losing a 4v5 that I was winning because my game crashed twice due to the same stupid error is really annoying.

movies,"I would really like to see the original producer's cut. It sounds weird since the classic film nerd ideal is to see a director's cut of something, but I first saw this film in 2006 or 2007 or something. Redux was the only available rental version of the film so I watched that, and I later sought out the original cut version from many other rental stores and later still, Torrent sites. All I could find was Redux.

When I watched Redux, of course I liked the film, Apocalypse Now is a great film. However I felt it was too long and given I already had the knowledge that this was a special director's cut I began trying to guess which scenes were likely added back in. Of course, the director's cut could have been shorter, or the same but with minor differences or things swapped, but I figured this was likely a simple case of material cut. I looked up what the difference actually was between the original cut and Redux and found I had been remarkably accurate in guessing what was added back in. I don't think this is because I'm particularly astute, I think it's because those those scenes were probably rightly cut for time.

Really none of them save perhaps for the French scene could be argued to have narrative impact and they all seemed to be just time wasters. The French scene in particular, from memory seemed like a well scripted and shot, piece of art that belonged in a different film.

Does anyone know where I can find the original 1979 cut? I have a feeling it'd be better.",0

Showerthoughts," In a single transaction? No, that's still a lot of money either way.

 It's also about scaling over time. For example, if the month starts out knowing you've got 5 available work days a week, 4 weeks in the month, you make $100 (net) a day, and at the end of the month you better have $1,200 for housing; your take home total after a full month of work is $800. From that, food is likely going to be $250 - $300. Throw in another $60 for a phone, $100 for internet (yeah, you can get cheaper, but let's not kid ourselves here). If only retroactively, clothes and other upkeep will be like $40. Paying for transportation is gonna be about $70 ($300 if you have a car). Then if you want some kind of entertainment budget, it's probably modest to put that at about $80 a month. And you're middle class, so probably saving at least 10% for retirement ($300)

 So after all that... there's $220 left in savings. That's without a car. With a car, probably making a cut somewhere, like not saving so much for retirement. God forbid you have pets or kids, or both, or any loans, or you have expensive medical costs your employer doesn't take care of.",0

What's interesting to me is that my grandfather was a firmly working-class man from Glasgow. He set out to get his children the opportunities he didn't have, and he achieved that goal. So I might be what I am, but it's largely because somebody decided 70 years ago that his descendants were going to be that. It's weird how things can turn. He lived and died as what he was and he couldn't change that, but he could influence the future. Hence here I am, and I can't change it either except for my own descendants.

Showerthoughts,"&gt;It truly is built around the idea that someone on $100k/year can afford an accountant to reduce their 'taxable income' to lower brackets and still come out ahead.

I disagree.  I think there is a moral issue that people who earn more should pay more taxes.    I'm in roughly the same boat as you in terms of salary/progressive taxing system, but I guess the socialist in me doesnt mind it as much.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember going to a TNA house show in Columbus, OH sometime between 07' and 09' (?). It was in June or July. Mickie James and Angle were there among others.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the show, Don came out said, for $40-50 (I don't recall exactly how much), you could meet the stars backstage. Some people did. Then, 2 hours later, during intermission, he came out and said you could meet the stars backstage for like $20. By this point, my buddies and I were 5-6 beers deep (having drank a couple before the show) and, hey, $20 bucks to meet Kurt Angle and Mickie James sounds like a great deal now. So we do - and TNA makes another $100 just from our little group for doing absolutely nothing more than they were already doing. We weren't the only ones either as the backstage area became filled with at least another dozen people.

If TNA raked in a thousand dollars more per show with this gimmick, the WWE could probably rake in 10.",0

It means wages have stagnated while costs (especially homes and healthcare) have gone up, and our sense of what ‚Äúrich‚Äù is has been horribly skewed by the small number of ultra-wealthy.

pics,"Peter Kirby, the author of Child Labour in Britain, 1750-1870 (2003), has pointed out that many mine owners stopped employing young children, not because it was illegal, but because they were considered to be inefficient. ""In the complicated ventilation systems of larger pits, young and inexperienced 'trappers' were often held responsible for causing explosions by leaving open their ventilation doors, and the exclusion of the very young children from complex ventilation systems, where it was applied, had a tangible effect in reducing accidents from explosions.""

He then goes onto argue that ""in less advanced colliery districts, where pits were small or where haulage in narrow seams was necessary and demand for child workers relatively higher, colliery owners were afforded virtual immunity from inspection and prosecution under the Act."" In other words, ""the Mines Act tended to be applied only where it was in the interests of colliery owners"". 

It was not until 1872 that the age of boys who could work in the coalmines was raised to 12 and eventually to 13 in 1903. Even so, there is a great deal of evidence to show that colliery owners continued to employ children illegally for many years afterwards. https://spartacus-educational.com/Child_Labour.htm",0

relationship_advice,"From your update in the comments, I'm assuming you've spoke to him by now.

I'll cut the crap in this comment and just give 2 different opinions:

1) IF they used a sperm bank as a go-between, you're really overreacting in my opinion. It's his body, and if he doesn't want anything to do with the kid? That's completely fine. As a male, the idea of helping someone create life (of course in a non-legally binding way where there is no sex involved) is kinda nice in some weird way. 
It was 100% a bit of a dick move not to tell you, but, if they used a sperm bank and your fianc√© has decided not to be involved with the child as if it is his child, then just postpone the marriage, and try to work around this, let him show you if he truly cares. I don't think this is worth fucking up a relationship that otherwise seems so good.

2) IF they fucked... just leave. There's no workaround. 'Insemination' is stand-in for 'we did sexual shit together but Peter didn't want me to fuck up your engagement.' This is really the more likely option, so in my opinion, just leave unless he can get some sort of proof he used a sperm bank.

Obviously those are my opinions, expecting downvotes for that first one, but oh well. Good luck OP.",0

Showerthoughts,"You *do not*. Nowhere in Canada would your family be paying anywhere near a 70% marginal rate, because it doesn't fucking exist.

You also seem to be confusing average tax rates and marginal tax rates. They are very different things. Somebody making $350,000 and somebody making $200,000 do not end up with the same amount of after-tax income, bud. That's just not true, at all. It's hilarious that you're trying to claim any knowledge whatsoever about Canada's tax structure when you don't even understand the basics of marginal tax rates.

Where do you live? $350,000 would have an average tax rate of 37%-46% depending on the province or territory, with most Canadians paying in the low-40s before deductions. Seeing as you're obviously a dependent child, your father has deductions. I'd be very surprised if they crack a 40% average, let alone 70%.",0

Showerthoughts,"What are you on about. I don‚Äôt think anywhere in the world has a tax system that uses a flat rate in such a way that people making more money just lose out. 

You said you live in Canada, the top rate of federal tax there is 33% on income over $210,371. Depending on where you live the territorial rate will differ, but at most it will be 21% on income &gt;$150,000. Your father *is not* paying an effective tax rate of 70%, he‚Äôs paying a max rate of 54% and that‚Äôs only on income above  $210,000 meaning his income under that level will be taxed at a reduced rate.

Less people caring about the game is not an objective statement unless you can back it up with facts like player count numbers and lower twitch viewership does not warrant less interest otherwise rainbow six siege would be dead.

On top of that I do not consider their updates to be slow. They are on pace with most games and have stated that big changes will be coming with each season. Unless you are strictly only comparing them to fortnite which literally has about 700 employees working on it from epic plus people from People Can Fly where as respawn has roughly 200-300 employees of which I would garner around half are working on apex with the other half broken up between star wars and their vr project. So you are literally comparing their output to a company with 7x the employees which is just not logical. Not to mention the unruly amount of hours epic makes employees work.

 One reason you could be getting paired with people from different regions is because those people can be queuing into different regions for various reasons such as it's an off time for their region, low player count in their region(Australia for example).",0

relationship_advice,"&gt;So as the title says, they found out that we‚Äôve had sex. His parents are  from a culture in which sex is taboo and they believe that once having  sex a woman‚Äôs value is lessened. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's **their** problem. Not yours. 

You need to completely cut contact with these bigots.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They have now resulted in yelling at my boyfriend everyday for the past  week since they have found out, calling me a whore and saying that they  will never accept me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only question that matters is did this affect your boyfriend's interactions with you? 

Don't take crap from the parents, ignore them. If they come at you themselves then just go to the police and ask for a restraining order.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; He tried talking to them today and they held their stance, even when he  told them that he‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve been with and that we are serious  about each other, and just overall defending me and our relationship. 

Your boyfriend needs to stop telling those people details about your sex life. You're in the US now. They have absolutely nothing to do with your genitals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; He has implied that he believes his parents will abandon him and shut  him out if he stays with me, and that he can‚Äôt handle that.

OPs shower thought was, imo, trying to consolidate what the feeling of being middle class sums to, and I think OP nailed it. In the middle of the middle class $100 would be a lot to spend on a perishable item(s), like a single meal for example.

So the communication was off and the timing as off as he got blasted sideways which might have been a better angle but it was further away and he would have been out of range.

So even if I give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was planned it was a bit off. As in, Naut threw the hook too early and it didn't matter, and even if he got that right he got blasted further away from the target so he didn't position flash where he needed to.",0

Thats the dumbest thing to say. How many people died because of the flu in the last 50 years. Not many. Let's stop treating it then.

Federal tax brackets (which means there‚Äôs also territory or state or other local taxed as well, admittedly I don‚Äôt know Canada‚Äôs tax system well), start at 15% for the first $47,630, then you‚Äôre taxed at 20.5% for ONLY the next 47,629 (from $47,630 to $95,259), then 26% on the next $52,408 of income, the. 29% on the next $62,704, and then finally anything additional made over $200,000 a year is taxed at 33%

Besides, she was honest. She might not have wanted to hurt you, she just wanted you to understand why she couldn't be as enthusiastic about your initial weight loss as you were.

We do not know ex reasons for meeting unless you have talked more. He will be on respectful behavior, no flirting, touching.

MortalKombat,"People who claim they'd ban from the game anyone over this is just putting up a fake fire and smoke to scare people. The worst that can happen is locking shit away again.

As NRS claimed multiple times there is:

1. Nothing in the Krypt that can be only unlocked with real money, therefore you don't cause any potential financial loss by opening the pike chests.
2. Nothing in the Krypt that has any effect on online PvP matches, therefore you don't get any kind of upper hand in online by rushing these chests via the glitch. Plus you are not breaking the EULA by modifying game files or anything.

Now I'm all for legit play, but I'll proudly admit I did all the chests AFTER I realized:

1. What the requirements are. Absolute insanity of time requirement to get them all - and don't get me started that none of that shit counts for the character summoned tower unless you have that specific character tower summoned at the time.
2. They hid away all the chests you really want (intro animations, victory animations, coolest gear and skins) in chests that are locked in a room that opens up only after getting enough heads on the pikes. So you have 4 intros and win animations, right? 1+1 unlocked by default. 1+1 is in the character tower, 1+1 in the head pike chest, and 1+1 in Shang Tsung's throne room (and 2 siderooms of that which unlock with more headpikes). So when you read ""unlocked in the krypt"" or ""unlocked in towers of time"" you have 0% chance to find them randomly, everything is locked away behind hundreds of fatalities that WILL make you hate doing and watching them forever and that's the kind of experience I had with Injustice 2 Legendary Gear so learning from my mistake, nope, never again. If it wouldn't be this beyond insane grindy I'd actually do them the legit way (like 10-15 fatalities but 50?!) but after learning what the requirements are, nope, fuck this shit. I have a job, a girlfriend, barely time to play and get better and I still have to babysit the AI in some cases, when would I have time to get competitive and play online if I have to spend MONTHS of my life babysitting the AI to unlock a single animation? Like, what the fuck do they expect from us? Yeah I'll be here in a year playing MK11 but I don't intend to babysit the AI at that point, I want to be competitive online. This is the kind of thing you should unlock away NATURALLY within the first 2-3 weeks or so and enjoy it from there, but that's not happening with the current requirements.",0

One a dude who yelled at me for not reviving him outside the circle during stage four when I died to the circle.. 

Had 0 meds and no way of getting either of us alive.

And another that I remember because they kept complaining I was getting downed and calling me a stupid white boy. Kept asking them to pick me up, as they focused soly on loot. They eventually let me die, tbagged my box till I could no longer respawned and assured me they were carrying me through the game thus far.

Final score rolls up, I had been dead for over ten minutes, they had fought in three other team battles since then and did a whopping 50 more damage than me.. Only to lose the final fight in a 2v1 because he did not revive me and his buddy died. Probably one of my favorite moments of, yep, youre totally the best player ever man.

But overall, the game lacks toxicity to the point that I can recall people being toxic because of how rare it actually is.",0

relationship_advice,"He shouldn‚Äôt have to support his young children unless I stay in a romantic relationship with him? What sense does that make? I will still be supporting them. 
As far as the house, etc. I have no intentions of trying to make any of this difficult or take anything from him I can‚Äôt get myself. I want to be doing things on my own, not acquiring things from another person anymore. This comment goes along with some of the reason I want to do this. Everyone looks at mothers who stay home with their children like they are a drain on their families &amp; they are barely contributing &amp; the husband is the one who is doing everything. This couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. I was jealous he could leave the house 40+ hours a week to work. &amp; that‚Äôs ALL he had to do while I did everything for the kids, everything for their school &amp; extra curricula‚Äôs, cooking, cleaning, errands, bill paying. appointments, &amp; was in school on top of it. He works, comes home, eats the food I made, sleeps or plays video games, goes to bed. To me, that seems like the life. Not having me around might be good for him to actually have to do things himself &amp; forge a relationship with his children.

Edit to add: As far as the house, we bought it together &amp; I am the one who did every bit of paperwork, leg work, etc to get it. Every drop of paint, home improvement, anything in the house- I did it. I did all the hard and landscaping by myself outside &amp; bought every piece of furniture 2nd handing &amp; updated it. I have to beg for weeks to get the lawn mowed &amp; have resorted to paying neighbors bc I got tired of waiting. Also, when we met for a year we both made about $9/hour. The difference is he climbed the ladder &amp; I got pregnant. So no, it was never about using him for money.",0

Middle income is a statistic. Middle class is about quality of life. $90k household income for a family of 4 is on the top end of working poor even in the Midwest. $90k for a single person living alone might be comfortable enough to be considered middle class.

EDIT: To stave off additional outrage, yes, I was too flippant in saying $90k ‚Äúmight‚Äù be middle class if they‚Äôre single with no dependents.

Showerthoughts,"&gt; Back in the day, in the US, ""middle class"" meant being able to make payments on your own car and house. If you lived in the suburbs, you were middle class. Adding a timeshare or vacation cabin wouldn't push you out of the middle class, but a Beverly Hills mansion would.

That's basically how I would understand it, though UK here. If you can maintain a reasonably comfortable lifestyle in a middle-range area, I'd call it middle class.   
  
Most working class (and even some lower middle class) people I know just don't have spare money at all. They generally just run out of money right before pay day, then pull through. That's considered ""normal""; ""problematic"" is when you can't pull through to pay day and end up having to get into debt. Someone having multiple thousands in the bank spare?

Sure, the reports only show this happening to Fortnite players at the moment, but I don't trust them to not do it on the platform itself or in other games on their platform.

Setting up routing rules on my firewall for a service like that is nigh impossible and I'm not sabotaging what I've done when I can just avoid the service altogether.  That combined with the fact that I dislike their practice of buying exclusivity onto what is objectively a worse platform.

So expecting Harper, who has no theatrical experience, to have a convincing southern accent is ridiculous. 

But this is nothing new coming from Vince. The man has punished a ton of people for the tiniest of things throughout the years. I just feel bad for wrestlers nowadays because outside of the WWE,  they don't have a NWA or a WCW or a ECW to fall back to. Yes, there are hundreds of indie promotions out there and a good amount do fine business, but there isn't another wrestling promotion that has the kind of TV/PPV deal that WCW had in the 1990's. There isn't another competitor who can really help elevate a person's brand outside the WWE. Not yet at least.

Edit: Also, Harper is not a young guy. He's 39 years old. So not only is WWE not releasing him from his contract, but they're holding back whatever ring time Luke Harper may still have.

Nowadays you‚Äôre lucky to do anything but try and work to get more money for your family working 50 hours a week an getting 10 hours overtime and a half a week and still making dirt. If you didn‚Äôt go to college, or maybe even if you did in some cases, you don‚Äôt get to dream about other things besides where your next meal for your kid is coming from.",0

Showerthoughts,"Yep. Along with many other pieces of witless nonsense peddled by the likes of the Mail, the expression 'Champagne socialist' is near the top of my least favourite. 

It's like they literally cannot understand any perspective outside of their own, which is particularly absurd given that their entire outlook is based on *fucking changing your own circumstances.* Yep, I'm a leftie, same as you. Because I owe my current life to left-wing policies, because my ancestor was a union man who was protected by the labour movement which in turn meant he could enable our future. Now people can say what they will about private schooling, and I understand the arguments against it, but that's just the icing on the cake. Things were set in place before even my mother was born. 

They're all completely bonkers.",0

RoastMe,You are kinda cute tbh.,0
apexlegends,They use the same reasoning as people on PC using cheats for the most part.  They will also defend it is not an advantage.  There is a reason there is NO aim assist on PC.  You can snap aim and track allot easier and control recoil very easily with a mouse.  PUBG had this problem and they just now finally put a policy in place for bans using 3rd party perfs.,1

relationship_advice,"I wouldn‚Äôt put all my eggs in one basket and focus on this one person. Keep normal communication open with her and if opportunity knocks do something with her ( but not an official date). I think you need to reestablish yourself in her life sort to speak.

If she seems to want to hang out more you have an answer and the could move forward.",0
relationship_advice,"True, but as far as I'm aware the UK only has a law on legal sexual age, and after that the law doesn't care, it's down to personal beliefs. I have a problem with massive age gaps, and am sceptical on the ages here, but it's hard to judge from an outside perspective.

You should also find an article about marginal and average tax rates. Hell, go find an online income tax calculator and put in a few dummy values. It'll give you both the marginal rate and average rate.",0

Showerthoughts,"Sorry, but saving money doesn't make you not poor. $200 a month may enable you to get an education and improve you job prospect, but that's investing, not saving.

Saving money beyond what liquidity you need for survival and emergencies is just an extra tax via gov directed inflation (they make free money and yours loses value). Currency itself is just a means to exchange goods, not accumulate wealth.

The biggest single factor to increasing your wealth is increasing your income bar none. Put every extra penny you have into paying off short term and high interest debt then put every penny into improving your skills and resume for a higher paying job.

Good on you for living below your means, this is your flexibility to enable you to earn more in the future.",0

trashy,"I just want to make it clear that I was not saying that this is a ""new thing"", or that I'm just noticing it now, which seems to be the misconception that everyone is getting.  But the people like the one in the picture seem to be more comfortable with letting anyone with an Internet connection know about it, instead of just the like-minded racist scum that they are friends with.  The Internet also gives them an easier way to attack and threaten people.  I've been aware of it my whole life, and I've seen it first hand, as there have been a decent amount of non-white people that I've known or that have lived in my area, and I've heard people talking about them in a negative way.",0

BUG HERE: 

The bug where you die the second you become invisible is back.

You use a shadow grenade and then die immediately. This can be done by: Being shot, The Ocean, Playground respawn button, etc.

Upon respawning, you become invisible until you use another shadow grenade. The only way to see the person who has done this bug is if they are holding something that is able to be viewed in a player's ""hands"" (EG. Pump shotgun)",0

I get it, you are still attached to her. But given the information you have given us, I truly believe cutting her off is the right thing to do. Don't feel bad about it, it's your happiness that you should prioritize. You deserve to be happy. She does not make you happy. Do the math.",0

gaming,"As far as rigs go, you gotta ask yourself a few questions first. How much can you spend, is this rig going to be put in a permanent spot, will you use the rig for 2d gaming too, does it need to be small or can you go for the big boy size? Do you want a future-proofed system or a system that works great for the next couple years? follow up to the last question, how often will you use it? What kind of games will you play on it? Do you want the best VR expedience or a next best experience (like your son's Rift). Are you going to do flight and racing sims?

Once you have answers, it's pretty easy to start picking out parts to build what you need. 

Just so know, the best vr kit available (Valve Index) is severely back-ordered since pre-orders just happened yesterday, you may have to wait until the end of the year. ($1000 for full kit)

Samsung Odyssey+ WMR kit is the next best bet and those things are only $300-$500 and don't need outside sensors. Though they have tracking occlusion when you put your hands beyond your waist.

Rift S is not really a great spec's headset that is coming out (also back-ordered today like crazy), so I'd pass on it if you want a better experience than Rift offers.",0

It‚Äôs the case in LA, Chicago, Atlanta, and every other black majority neighborhood I have ever been to. I have even been told by Chinese and Korean people I‚Äôve spoken to about it.

I‚Äôm not aware of a single individual running one of these businesses who has the slightest ounce of respect for black people, hires anyone black, circulates any of the money they make back into our community, isn‚Äôt completely rude, etc. Operating business in a community for the sole purpose of extracting money and having a long history of discriminating against the people, not hiring them, selling low quality products, and constant abuse is real systematic racism. And yet we would never be allowed to open a business in an Asian community because you wouldn‚Äôt patronize it or try to block us out entirely. These are the people I‚Äôm talking about.",0

leagueoflegends,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say Yuumi would be a good adc to play but honestly I can‚Äôt agree with that.

First, she is very squishy when not attached to anyone. And when she attaches, she can‚Äôt auto attack. So being an adc means to ignore her most important and unique skill and put herself in danger.

Second, some people say in teamfight if the enemy team go for you, you can simply attach to a tank to get out of danger. But the point is, as an adc you want to constantly deal damage during teamfight. Attaching to a tank will not only make your team lack damage at that moment, it also puts you in a bad position, since tank should always be the front line.

Third, people sees Yuumi‚Äôs attach as an good escape skill for adc. But then she can‚Äôt do one of the most important things that adc do, which is kiting. As an adc you usually want to kite when running away, and that can turn a fight around.",0

movies,"&gt;I don't think strategy was ever compromised over insane visuals.

You would be dead wrong about that. Helm's deep has a slew of it's own problems that made no sense. There are countless of examples of this with numerous long youtube videos analyzing various aspects

1. The main gate was a wooden door a few inches thick that was destroyed by basically a log. Throw some concrete in or stone in there and you are safe. 
2. No Trenches of any sort outside the Wall
3. A Giant Drain Hole at the center of the wall
4. Orcs stupidly run up to the wall and just wait there doing nothing
5. The Orc with the detonation torch ran completely unarmored WITH A GIANT TORCH so everyone could see him
6. A Bunch of them charged out of the main keep on horses (Which they basically pulled out of nowhere) 
7. Orcs showed up with PIKES to a SIEGE

Those are just the ones i thought about in the last 5 minutes. Helms Deep remains as one of my favorite battles, as it does for many people. Back then, people watched these things for entertainment. They didn't go frame by frame looking for things to complain about and then spend a total of 5 seconds thinking about the validity of their criticism. This describes literally every argument you made about the game of thrones episode

Spoiler Ex:

&gt;!No Archers until it was too late: Long Archers in medieval time took decades to train. Not Years, Decades. You saw some at the battle of the Bastards. During the battle for Winterfell, you only see a handful of Long Archers, with everyone else having crappy short range bows that likely cant kill someone 50m away. When the enemy was in range of archers, they put up archers on the wall. !&lt;",0

Like many said it depends on how this affects his life. If it doesn't impact it negatively then what is the harm? 10 games isn't even long when most games are 30 minutes or less. That's like 5 hours of playing. 6 at most.

So black people who move from the Carribean aren't allowed to have black pride? Black people in Africa aren't allowed to have black pride? You seem to have a very specific view of who is allowed to feel proud of *what*.


&gt;How does having pride in ‚Äúwhite heritage‚Äù make sense if, not too long ago, White was far narrower and excluded people that would be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù today.

It's almost like you've pointed out that the common use of white has evolved to encompass people of white skin, and their respective heritages.  



&gt;It just doesn‚Äôt make sense, as a statement, because your heritage would both be the people that said you weren‚Äôt white and the people they said weren‚Äôt white.

No, because I'm not selectively bouncing back and forth between language and its use a hundred years ago and current day and selectively applying it to suit my argument because I'm not suffering from delusional levels of cognitive dissonance.

&gt;What is white pride even for? Why fucking have it? There‚Äôs no struggle that came with it

It kind of is though when you use words like ""perfect time"" and ""clean hook""   Let me just say, I am with you for the most part, IF they planned it, its pretty crazy and props to them for trying it on the fly like that and getting close.

However If we generalize massively there is 2 kinds of people. The positive and the negative. You trying to be overly positive will just make us negative people go ""well wait a second"" and start arguing like I am now.

That's my issue. It's like I get you want to give them props and they probably deserve but when you go a little overboard the negative nancys like me are gonna come out and start arguing.

I am not saying this is what you did, but I hate when people are overly praised just for the sake of it. A good play can be a good play, doesn't need to be perfect and god like etc. That's where I am coming from anyway.",0

Showerthoughts,"I read somewhere this interesting classification for middle class. The idea was not to measure earnings themselves but ""financial independence"" instead. Having strong middle class is very important for politics because your financial situation will not cloud your political decisions so much. 

For example, if you earn 100k but have a mortgage and worry that you will be fired and have problems finding new job because of openly demonstrating your political views - you are not middle class. 

If you are a self-employed plumber with 40k living comfortably in a small town somewhere with no other good plumbers around - you might be middle class, as you can openly express your political views without them jeopardizing your life too much.

In other words - middle class is about freedom to express your political views, not about the paycheck. And if you think like this - it makes much more sense in context of ""country should have a healthy middle class"".",0

Showerthoughts,"Middle class is bigger than wage. A high school teacher pulling 25k is usually middle-class; an oil rig worker pulling 100k usually isn't.

&gt;The US has at least¬†two different systems¬†of what gets termed ""socioeconomic class"". They are everywhere conflated, and this is bad.
&gt;
&gt;Two of them I will term¬†economic class¬†and¬†social class.
&gt;
&gt;Economic class¬†refers to money. It refers to the wealth or poverty of a person, and to the privileges they do or do not have because of their economic might or lack thereof.
&gt;
&gt;Social class¬†is what is being referred to by such terms as ""middle class"", ""working class"", ""white collar"", ""professional"", ""blue collar"", and the pejoratives ""white trash"" and ""townie"".
&gt;
&gt;It is a common confusion ‚Äì or intellectual dodge ‚Äì to conflate social class with economic class. But what what differentiates, say, the middle class from the working class is not mere wealth or earning power; as we all know, a plumber (presumed working class) may make much more money than a professor (presumed professional).

MortalKombat,"It's not making it so that a move comes out any earlier. There's just two opportunities for the special move to come out when release check on. Both on button down and on button up. This is standard behavior for Street Fighter and most other fighting games. There isn't even an option to turn it off on most of these.

A good example of why you wouldn't want this is if you want to crouch near-punch cancel into a back-forward special when your character has a down-back near-punch special. With release check on it is very easy to inadvertently get crouch near-punch into the down-back near-punch special on the button up.

However in my opinion the biggest offender is the shortcuts which will allow for the down-back special to trigger before down is released.",0

And if you think about it, respawning often isnt even worth it. Most of the times my team already has looted the crates and im stuck with a p2020 without reserve ammo. Even better when they just respawned you and ran away so you get farmed by another team.

When i respawn someone i give him my second weapon (which is dumb btw cause again 99.9% of these randos are useless). So at least he is shooting and distracting the enemy or has the Chance to survive. After all its a team game. But i dont see teamwork at all with most of the random teams.

""You taste good.""

The vampress had the little twink right where she wanted him. Futilely squirming beneath her. 

""I want more.""

A few more kisses were planted in a trail from the young man's ear to neck where long canines scraped his delicate pale skin. He gasped as fangs sank into he artery. At the same time a different kind of penetration took place further below. The crepuscular dominatrix had worked her girth member into the tight ring of her prey's anus. Spit from an earlier throat swabbing eased its passage to press hard against his prostate. A giggle escaped the vampire's lips as she found the slut button deep in his ass. He was putty in her hands and she knew it. 

Her hands roamed the supple body that now belonged to her, but she made sure to keep  one on his head running through his hair l, stroking him like a pet. As he became more light-headed, he reached up to lovingly caress his mistress back. Darkness clouded the edges of his vision, and a final thought flitted across his addled mind.

I'll leave you with this, a few snippets of a conversation between Barr and Mueller that was so quickly buried yesterday when it didn't agree with the narrative you guys have been suckling from: ""In that call, Mueller said he was concerned that media coverage of the obstruction probe was misguided and creating public misunderstandings about the office's work.""

When Barr pressed Mueller on whether he thought Barr's memo to Congress was inaccurate, Mueller said he did not but felt that the media coverage of it was misinterpreting the investigation.

Documentary standard is about 10-30:1. Which, for a quick turn around and stunt heavy episode like this, is actually about what I‚Äôd expect. So likely 15-45 hours of raw footage edited into this episode alone. I‚Äôd expect about 120-140 hours raw footage for the season.

Showerthoughts,"Mate, you literally don't know what the words ""middle class"" are even supposed to mean, so you shouldn't be arguing about what the definition should be. It has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of money you make, and it isn't the same size regardless of what the wealth distribution is, it's a function of the wealth distribution. 

You don't have to be living in poverty to be working class, a tradesman can make a hundred grand and still be working class, someone who works on an oil rig or some other extremely dangerous but mundane job can make twice that and still be working class, and his manager who works in an office building on the shore might make less than him and be middle class. 

The middle class are the people that the wealthy keep around to keep the working class in check, that's what that phrase refers to. But by allowing the billionaires to redefine the phrase to be about how much money you make and to push the value lower every year, you're allowing them to take away your power.

i didnt even have to read the rest of this, your boyfriend sounds like he might seriously have BPD or other anger issues. partially fixable or at least better with therapy. 


&gt;he‚Äôs called me a bitch numerous times, a slut, a whore. Just out of nowhere.

again echoing some mental issues and the need for the right healthcare professional


&gt;I just don‚Äôt have any idea what to do.

personal opinion but stay away from people who get called out for their anger problems, or worse admit to them, and yet continue to be shitty. if youve tried to talk to him about the source of this and been going through these social fuckups and making excuses for him, then it sounds like youve already made up your mind but just need to hear it from some other people. leave him and block him. guys like that are danger.

#Relevancy Guidelines

All posts should feature Fortnite or the associated culture in some way. 50% of all content posted must directly relate to Fortnite: Battle Royale.

- Adding text about Fortnite to an image/video does not make it related to Fortnite.
- Submissions must relate to or directly affect Fortnite or the Fortnite community, regardless of title.
- The title cannot be the only thing relevant to Fortnite. If you were to take the title away and it is not clear the post/image/video is related to Fortnite, your post will be removed.
- Look-a-likes are not allowed.
- Posts about clickbait YouTube channels are prohibited.
- Save The World posts belong on /r/Fortnite.
- IRL Fortnite dances/emotes are generally disallowed unless they are done by an athlete or celebrity, or are unique

- Videos and images captured in Creative mode then posted in relation to BR **must** use replay mode for cinematic purposes only. The only exceptions to this are new item demos and training courses.

- Videos and images filmed in Creative must not show Creative-only items (coins, music blocks, etc.)

- Training courses and new item demo videos are allowed to be filmed in Creative and posted to BR.  This means if you are practicing for BR in a training course, or showing off a new item, you may share a clip.  Deathruns or any other type of obstacle course are not allowed. If you created a training course and want to showcase it, you must post it in r/FortniteCreative. Only gameplay from these courses is allowed on BR. Any posts showcasing a creation you made may be subject to removal, and you may not share creative codes.

Sadly human nature means there's no good solution here. He made bad choices and didn't want to talk about them, now he's in a bad position and wants to complain about it. You're frustrated that he didn't listen to you in the past, and don't want to have to listen to him complaining now, but you also care about him and want him to be OK. Broadly speaking a bit of compromise is the best bet, you trying to be OK with **some** complaining, despite him getting himself where he is, but that also means him acknowledging how he's ended up here and not shutting you down when you try and talk about it.

Which means that you're within your rights, I'd say, to tell him that you'll absolutely be sympathetic and listen to his complaints, **if** he'll listen to you about the changes he should make. He can't have it both ways, where he gets to ignore you but expects you to care endlessly about his self-inflicted circumstances. Whether he'll accept that is another matter of course.",0

On the hominin branch there are many bushes. Modern man had sex with hominins in Africa, with neanderthals, with denisovans, and others too; neanderthals and denisovans had hybrids (as genomic analysis has shown). Probably others too - for all we know Moon Boy was getting it on too ...

Remember even a stranger from another village from the same species could be scary. 

It is unclear if , in spots, neanderthals and modern humans co-existed. 

In any case, I think 'distinctness' of human species are still blurry by physiognomy, cultural habits, practices, genomes etc. Some say speech might be a differentiator for modern man; other think differently.

Oh, so now I'm a liar... Ok. Wait, not just a liar, a ""bold"" liar. :) No need to resort to ad hominems, I've done nothing but tell the truth as I see it. Though I'm human and I may have left out details or forget some things, but I assure you, it's not on purpose.

&gt; It's been well over a month since you were told about him. 

Yes, and I told the person (or rather, troll, since that what they were doing at the time) that I would look into it via PM (which I provided proof of). Unfortunately, as I stated earlier (though to your credit, it may have been to someone else in this thread that I said this too) my father died so I dropped off of reddit for a few weeks. When I came back, I had nearly forgotten about it. Did I drop the ball? Maybe. But he's gone now. Problem solved. Did feet get dragged? Possibly, but if it was the case, it wasn't intentional. As I've shown earlier, I've removed racist mods from my mod team before. Why would I not remove Manbra if that was the case?

&gt;  Not my fault reddits mods consistently demonstrate themselves to be incompetent power tripping cretins that cover each others backs

Two things. First, ""reddit mods"" covers thousands, if not tens of thousands of people. We're a diverse group with equally diverse values and beliefs. Treating mods as one monolithic group is not just inaccurate, it's ignorant. Second, believe it or not, most mods aren't covering for each other. I've yet to see that happen in any subs I've been moderating and I've been here a long time. I mean, it's different if the mods know each other in real life and are besties or something, but what you're seeing as ""covering each other's backs"" is usually not wanting to step on another mod's toes without good reason. In fact, I see mods wanting to backstab other mods *orders of magnitude* more often. They like the power and taking down mods above them increases their power. This is *way* more common than mods covering crap up for each other.

&gt;  It's ridiculous to comment publically about moderation issues? Commenting on a different sub is ridiculous?

So **now** who's lying? Lying by omission as well; Dragging a witch-hunt into another unrelated subreddit is ridiculous. This wasn't a calm debate about moderation issues either, it was a targeted witch-hunt against a mod the person had previous issues with.  Rather than PM me, or send a modmail to *the entire rest of the mod team*, they chose to publicly witch-hunt. They wanted outrage, they wanted pitchforks and people screaming for his head. Well they got it, he received death threats. I don't care how racist someone is, nobody deserves death threats.

#Relevancy Guidelines

All posts should feature Fortnite or the associated culture in some way. 50% of all content posted must directly relate to Fortnite: Battle Royale.

- Adding text about Fortnite to an image/video does not make it related to Fortnite.
- Submissions must relate to or directly affect Fortnite or the Fortnite community, regardless of title.
- The title cannot be the only thing relevant to Fortnite. If you were to take the title away and it is not clear the post/image/video is related to Fortnite, your post will be removed.
- Look-a-likes are not allowed.
- Posts about clickbait YouTube channels are prohibited.
- Save The World posts belong on /r/Fortnite.
- IRL Fortnite dances/emotes are generally disallowed unless they are done by an athlete or celebrity, or are unique

- Videos and images captured in Creative mode then posted in relation to BR **must** use replay mode for cinematic purposes only. The only exceptions to this are new item demos and training courses.

- Videos and images filmed in Creative must not show Creative-only items (coins, music blocks, etc.)

- Training courses and new item demo videos are allowed to be filmed in Creative and posted to BR.  This means if you are practicing for BR in a training course, or showing off a new item, you may share a clip.  Deathruns or any other type of obstacle course are not allowed. If you created a training course and want to showcase it, you must post it in r/FortniteCreative. Only gameplay from these courses is allowed on BR. Any posts showcasing a creation you made may be subject to removal, and you may not share creative codes.

movies,"That's fair, I am disappointed in the writing as well. Night King got Snoke'd, plot armor and questionable decisions all over the place, but I really have to hope there's a reason for all of it. I'm sincerely hoping the next episode or at least next 3 will make sense of the direction they decided to take with the Battle of Winterfell. Guess we'll be finding out in a couple days.

Anyway, ""budget"" was probably the wrong word. I really meant it as overall resources and probably should have corrected it. My original point was that comparing an absolute monster of a feat that is Lord of the Rings to one episode is unreasonable. Those movies had complete source material as a blueprint whereas these last seasons of GoT are treading unknown waters. Jackson's crew had all the resources they needed to achieve as faithful a recreation of the source material as they possibly could. It's what Peter Jackson does, he gets whatever he needs to complete every detail of his vision.",0

#Relevancy Guidelines

All posts should feature Fortnite or the associated culture in some way. 50% of all content posted must directly relate to Fortnite: Battle Royale.

- Adding text about Fortnite to an image/video does not make it related to Fortnite.
- Submissions must relate to or directly affect Fortnite or the Fortnite community, regardless of title.

- Posts about clickbait YouTube channels are prohibited.
- Save The World posts belong on /r/Fortnite.
- IRL Fortnite dances/emotes are generally disallowed unless they are done by an athlete or celebrity, or are unique

- Videos and images filmed in Creative must not show Creative-only items (coins, music blocks, etc.)

- Training courses and new item demo videos are allowed to be filmed in Creative and posted to BR.  This means if you are practicing for BR in a training course, or showing off a new item, you may share a clip.  Deathruns or any other type of obstacle course are not allowed. If you created a training course and want to showcase it, you must post it in r/FortniteCreative. Only gameplay from these courses is allowed on BR. Any posts showcasing a creation you made may be subject to removal, and you may not share creative codes.

I mean if you are self employed cleaner you might pay yourself $0 salary and $50,000 in dividend, but that means fuck all really.

Join the 95% of the world that defines middle class as the people who are middle income, and clearly segregate the upper middle from the middle as a VERY different thing.

You're meant to turn the volume to a level where dialogue sounds natural, and yes, there will of course be loud sounds, much louder than the dialogue. This is by design. Some things are loud. Explosions, gunshots, those things should be loud. Often times, it makes sense to have the music be louder than the dialogue too. Cramming them all together to closer volumes ruins the dynamics and just creates an overall flat sound. It may be easier to listen to at quieter levels, or on weaker systems, but those systems typically have a dynamic range compression setting for that purpose.

leagueoflegends,"Or maybe someone that can climb to rank 1 on any server has an Idea of how the game should be played? So far in his climb on EU he's seen some absolutely stupid shit. 

I remember 1 time specifically they refused to take inhib at like 17 mins, because they didn't want to give the enemy team free farm. 

They said ""In EU we don't take inhib here stupid NA player""

TF Blade commented that you take inhib 100 percent of the time there, because the enemy team is too far behind AND it's too early in the game to effectively clear the minions. That inhib would've given them free control over the entire map and let them take side outer towers for free. 

He said ""EU tries so hard to be smart, that they wrap back around to being stupid."" 

Even Dominate who believes overall EU players are better in certain aspects out right said the EU solo queue junglers are straight up worse than NA, Moe has said this, and TF Blade comments every game on the stupid shit BOTH teams junglers do.

So far watching all of their climbs they all straight up say EU's Macro in solo queue is garbage.

Everything from Baron calls, to Dragon control, to map decisions(made by junglers mostly), has been horrendous.

I have no doubt that EU Pros are consistently better, but the Average understanding of the game among high elo players in EU seems to be well below NA. Whether that's due to turkish or NE transfers fucking it up I don't know, but something is off.",0

If it means mortgage-free, then I'd agree that being in that scenario and so young almost certainly implies inherited wealth in one form or another, or an amazingly successful career 

However, if it means simply getting on the housing ladder, it'll vary very heavily by region. In Northern England, buying a house is very common in your late 20s, early 30s. In London, I'd expect it's almost impossible without help. House prices Vs wages are insane.",0

leagueoflegends,"I never said he would have stayed even with or without the 60 HP and the 10 MS. to think I said that just shows that you didn't read my answer for real.

I said that WITHOUT the HP and MS buff the overall changes would have still been buffs, not that these 2 changes would have kept him even. These are 2 totally different things.

To his other buffs:

1. P is stronger or even for most of the game
2. Q CD doesn't matter much early especially because it gets maxed first, but later on for all in fights it does so mostly a buff
3. Q slow duration buffed signficantly and slow power buffed early on
4. E HP reg buffed by 50% and shield power buffed, mana costs removed. That is pretty huge.

these are the buffs he got and not one of these except the P buff are minor.

For nerfs:

1. W self slow and grounded. Doesn't matter too much in soloQ. Still a decent nerf
2. W lower dmg but more useable/more frequent usage. Mostly even for soloQ
3. R rank 1 range nerf. A nerf that has the highest impact in competitive, rarely an impact in soloQ

To think that this change without the MS and HP would be a nerf for soloQ is already strange. With the MS and HP it was set to be a clear buff.

&gt;You are absolutely looking too hard at the winrates. The patch hasn't  been out for nearly long enough to determine how effective these changes  have been.

You are right that it is not out enough for long enough to determing how effective these changes were in the end, but it is pretty much 99% safe to say that they were buffs and increased his WR, the exact value (2% or 6% more) is still up in the air, but that it will land between these values and is a buff is pretty safe to say (a small chance still exists that the data was a huge outlaner, which can happen with low PRs but 1.5 is not low enough normally).",0

relationship_advice,"One of my friends cheated on his wife with a coworker. He fessed up to it, and it devastated them. They both went in to therapy and his therapist told him, if he wanted his wife to trust him again, he had to *be trustworthy*. This meant that when his coworker came into his office and closed the door, he opened it back up. If she started getting into personal talk, he redirected it to work. They were very good friends beforehand, so when she asked if they could be friends, he said no. It was unfair to his wife and DISRESPECTFUL. 

As you can see, he took care to change the circumstances that encouraged his cheating. If he didn‚Äôt, *he had no right to ask his wife to trust him*. 

Your bf has done NONE of those things. He is not being trustworthy, that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt deserve your time or trust.",0

SquaredCircle,"It's a twofold power move:

1. Harper would be a big acquisition for AEW. Not Moxley level, but the IWC (who is AEW's primary audience) would go bonkers if Brodie Lee appeared in AEW and that would drive viewers to the competition. Vince is preventing that. It's the same reason they seem to constantly sign indie/Japan stars and then do fuck all with them.

2. It sends a message to the rest of the roster that they can't expect to ask for a release so they can go off to greener pastures if they aren't happy in WWE.

The problem is that this environment is great for holding onto who they have now but it's going to be one hell of an issue when it comes to signing new names if it becomes a known situation that WWE will sign you and lock you in a box for as long as they can with no programs for you solely to hurt the competition.",0

ChapoTrapHouse,"It‚Äôs clearly not wrong. 

Have you ever noticed how the most respected news providers are accused of being BOTH left and right biased? That should tell you something. 

It‚Äôs pretty obvious that I‚Äôm correct. Let‚Äôs say the left and the right are discussing global warming. The left are more inclined to look at the upper-bound of damage, while the right are more likely to look at the lower-bound.

When the actual results come back, the real figure is between the two, usually almost exactly the centre. This isn‚Äôt just hypothetical. This is exactly what‚Äôs happened with climate change stats in the last 5 years. 

The majority of those on the left and on the right are not unreasonable people. Neither side is going to stray far from the truth. Both sides will be close to the correct answer, but will spin the argument so that it aligns with their arguments. And because of this, reality is usually in the dead centre.

[Pew defines](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/) the middle class as those earning between two-thirds and double the median household income.This means that the category of middle-income is made up of people making somewhere between $40,500 and $122,000. Those making less than $39,500 make up the lower-income bracket. Those making more than $118,000 make up the upper-income bracket. Easy, right?

There's nothing left for the kid(s).

Though I think u/flyinbryancolangelo _might_ have just hit on a way to penalize teams for employing guys like Hill: Dock them the cap amount of a discounted franchise tag for 3 seasons, regardless of contract length. In this case, the actual money would be paid to the kids from the Chiefs. Or the Patriots would have had to pay the money to Hernandez's children (trust funds?). In other cases, the penalty money is donated to whichever ""cause"" is most appropriate.

No penalty for a first offense, so ""risk"" players could still find teams willing to take a chance on them. But after a first-offense, the penalty becomes financial and isn't tied to the rookie pay scale. If Tyreek Hill sucked, he'd have been cut two months ago (?) when the rumors about this surfaced. He is only on the Chiefs roster today because he's _really good at football_ and the Chiefs don't want to let an minimum-wage asset go for free unless they have to. There _should_ be a penalty for employing a guy like Hill after his second (serious) offense. The Chiefs could cut his ass yesterday and have no fear about Cleveland getting an All-Pro player for ""free"". Cleveland could still choose to employ him after whatever suspension, but if he fucks up again, they lose ~$15M in cap space for three season. THAT would make owners think long and hard about claiming a guy like Hill (or WAS claiming Foster).",0

*""Hon, we need to talk. First off, I need you to know that I love you. I want the best things for you and for us as a family. So know that that's where this is coming from.""*

*""You have depression. It's hurting you. I can see it. Just as badly, it's hurting the people around you... and yeah, that includes me. It's not your fault. Your brain is just making the wrong chemistry happen, but it's something that needs to be fixed. I've tried coaxing and helping you to get help for yourself and that hasn't worked. So here's what's going to happen now. I am going to find a therapist who can help. You and I will go together. We will work with them and take the time we need to find the right mix of medications to help you get to a place where you can be happy. All you have to do is get in the car. I'll take care of the rest.""*

Hopefully she agrees. Then follow through ASAP. Hell, maybe even have an appointment set up before the conversation. You can always cancel or reschedule if it goes sideways. If she argues or puts up a fuss...

*""Stop. You seem to be confused. I am not asking. I am telling you that this is what is going to happen. I love you, and we* ***will*** *get you help. This is going to happen because we cannot continue on like we have been. It's gotten to the point where I am dreading coming home, and that's not a life I want to live. This is something that needs to be done, because I hope that neither of us wants to explore the other direction. So with the understanding that I both love you and am adamant that this needs to happen in order for us to continue on together, are you willing to let me help you?""*

That last part could potentially be labeled as controlling, but in this instance I would call it leading. You're in a position where being a bit forceful may help to save her and your marriage from her depression. If she resists the first approach, she needs to know that there's no whining her way out of this and that the issues in your relationship have come to a head. It's a softly delivered ultimatum couched in terms of wanting to help her. The caveat of course being... you have to be willing to move toward ending the relationship if she absolutely refuses to get some help for herself even in the face of losing her family and the comforts of her life.

ChapoTrapHouse,"&gt;The extermination of El Mozote was just a drop in the river of what happened in El Salvador during the 1980s. About 75,000 Salvadorans died during what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcivil war,‚Äù although almost all the killing was done by the government and its associated death squads.

&gt;The numbers alone don‚Äôt tell the whole story. El Salvador is a small country, about the size of New Jersey. The equivalent number of deaths in the U.S. would be almost 5 million. Moreover, the Salvadoran regime continually engaged in acts of barbarism so heinous that there is no contemporary equivalent, except perhaps ISIS. In one instance, a Catholic priest reported that a peasant woman briefly left her three small children in the care of her mother and sister. When she returned, she found that all five had been decapitated by the Salvadoran National Guard. Their bodies were sitting around a table, with their hands placed on their heads in front of them, ‚Äúas though each body was stroking its own head.‚Äù The hand of one, a toddler, apparently kept slipping off her small head, so it had been nailed onto it. At the center of the table was a large bowl full of blood.

Yes? But obviously not at the ones that are actually engaged with your people. The ones behind those ones.

MortalKombat,"Play your spacing well and be patient. When the pressure is heavy, wait for the opponents combo to stop and then poke with down + 1, if you get pushed backed further where the down + 1 wont connect then use down + 3 or if pushed a little further than that (like a baraka player using the double blade poke) use down + 4. These pokes will interrupt their pressure and if they mash after the poke, you will be able to poke again. Doing this will help you get advantage to start your ""turn"".

Also if you're playing against someone who is spamming combos that start with ""highs"" you can punish with a uppercut. Whiff punishing is a great way to get advantage to get your ""turn"". Another great way to stop pressure is punishing people's slower moves. Sub zero has a string that starts with a ranged ice axe poke (mid) into another punch (mid also I think) and then he will ice ball, here is where you punish because the ice ball can be slow if not enchanced with his ""dead of winter"" tournament varation (it has an enhanced ice ball that is very fast if he uses a bar of juice). If you are close enough to him (close enough to down + 1) you can punish him with any attack or combo starter that is quick. A simple example would be using any characters combo that usually starts with a 1, erron blacks 1 + 1 + 1 combo string will punish sub zero everytime he tries to ice ball in that combo string, also a throw here works everytime as well.

The other team was awful and the game took forever given how few of us there were. When we started at like 14v20, I think a whole squad on our team left by the time we had the third stone.

We ended up getting the last 3 stones with like 6-8 players on our team. All within a couple minutes of each other. By the time the last stone was dropping to the map, we made our way to it, rattled the other team into moving off the 4th stone, took it and finished the game with thanos at the last stone.

relationship_advice,"Time to step up and embrace the new opportunities. You need a plan, get out and start a new hobby or activity. Meet new people. You might not feel like it but of you want to have old friends you gotta make new friends, right? Don't be bitter, don't pursue the lady. If you act as if everything you say and do is going to be posted on YouTube, you'll probably avoid damaging your own reputation. But why not see your friend as a friend, let her go without rancour and you may save a lifelong friendship. Ex's can be loyal friends. But in any event, you need to keep it all together, deal with the practical stuff - where are you going to live, what's your budget and if it's more than your income what can you do about that?",0
leagueoflegends,"LoL literally stole SC2's ladder system in Season 2 without the intricacies of actually hard-tying it to MMR, the result is the shitfest the current ladder is where people of different abilities are scattered everywhere. You have shitters with hundreds of games under their belt in Diamond, and skilled players who mostly play normals, but have maybe 50-100 games only in gold, but are popping off and screwing the enemy every game. 

The fact that you, as a gold player, can play 10 games with Plat and Diamond players but not reach Plat, is a mistake and a problem. Sure, with enough games you will get there, but that just forces people to grind out games.

Also, so what if the ladder doesnt feel as rewarding - it's a ladder, you should only be playing ranked if you're playing to win - a LOT of LoL players forget this. Putting more people into normal games because they dont feel rewarded would increase game quality.

On a fresh 30 qccount in LoL, it takes you hundreds of games to reach your real rank if you're in the top 5% of the playerbase - that's a fucking problem in itself.

Leagues' ladded is designed to make people play as many games as possible in order to reach their actual rank - that's a problem. It feels cheap and frustrating to play ladder on a new account or for q new season because you simply are not playing games at your level for your first hundred games if you're actually 'good' at LoL.",0

Showerthoughts,"Middle class has little to do with income and pew only defines it that way cause it's easy. But class has no clear income boundaries. A better way to define it is based on the education your job requires. If it requires a college degree it is considered middle class. Another way to distinguish it is on the degree to which you follow orders vs. have autonomy in your job. So a plumber who owns a company is middle class but the guy who works for him is working class.

Income is a super bad measure bc it varies from place to place and by age and some working class jobs are very highly paid.  For instance my brother is a prison guard in the northeast and makes more than me, a professor in the southeast. But my job is considered middle or upper middle class while his is considered working class.

No patch has been specified but instead of pushing forward on the thumb-stick in order to run you have to now push down on the thumb-stick. This is a toggle but was never required originally. Originally all you had to do to run was push the thumb-stick forward not depress it also...this is my point it was fine how it was and now the depress mechanic almost acts like an undesired toggle to sprint button that gets in the way of general game-play causing the character to sprint / walk / sprint.

Showerthoughts,"You're taking a very historical version of the term middle while discounting the upper class.

What you're defining as middle class is modern day upper class. If you don't need to work, your debts are covered, and your money is making you money without you having to do anything, that's upper class.

You're middle class when you're in a position of upper management or lawyer or doctor or consultant. You still need to work for your income, but you're making money that you can put elsewhere to make you money, and you usually have some control over your hours.

Working class is clock in-clock out, or salaried but still living pretty closely to paycheck to paycheck. They may own a house or have some assets, but they aren't doing much in the way of saving for retirement or the future beyond what the company offers.

The middle class incomes and the top of working class incomes can overlap greatly. It's a more complex debt, income, and asset ratio. Class is a status, not a monetary value.",0

That‚Äôs your job not theirs if you really want to do this. 

Once your family realizes they can‚Äôt bully you out of this marriage and how firm you are, and how happy they make you, especially once they get to know the kids, they will come around eventually (if they really are as loving and close knit as you say they are and not just comeplete narcs) they push and tell you what to do cuz they can, and if you aren‚Äôt really fighting it/letting them control the realitionship you‚Äôre in then they were right to do it cuz you really couldn‚Äôt have been in love.

Showerthoughts,"Canada is a federation, which means that there is a division of powers between provinces and the federal government. One thing the provinces control is education, so each province has its own individual education system (although it's not like it's wildly different across the country).

Anyway, where I'm from (BC), we have general social studies for 3/5 years of high school, and then we can choose to go more in-depth in things like geography or history for the final two years. You can take any of the available options or none of them. General social studies still teaches you the basics, though. There's just more depth in the higher courses.

There was a mandatory Planning course, which kinda covers this sort of thing. We never went over taxes specifically, but did do things like create a household budget. There is also a ""Graduation Transitions"" course in the final year where you have to create a plan for after high school with a certain amount of depth, and the teacher in charge has to sign off on it being complete before you're allowed to graduate.

Just did my taxes recently. Biggest return in 16 years of work. Almost 10K cause I hit the jackpot with my new accountant. Maybe I live under a rock. I don't know. But I've been probably 8 out of these years without medical beneifits. I didn't know I could claim those expenses. As well as all the receipts pertaining to energy efficient products bought. My bus pass. I keep a receipt for mostly everything. So after doing this years. I went home and compiled all of what I could find. 

I feel like I can now lead my best female girlie life and afford to shop brand new. As well as be better put together. Take care of my esthetic needs better. I'm 32 and on my 10th year adulting outside of my parents house. Being HD Instagram ready hasn't been a priority. I used to be more invested in being a girl superficially. I was a Brooke Davis from One Tree Hill or Cordelia from Buffy type as a teen and living under my parents roof. With depth, compassion, and intelligence mind you. I just never wanted to be in debt whilst in University in the name of vanity. I just finished my masters in engineering last year. It took 12 years but I did it slowly to avoid insurmountable student debt.

I think what he meant by that comment is that by looking at the average game knowledge compared to NA(his home server) he doesn't get why EU are more successful if the Average player is worse. 

The top LEC players are straight up beasts. Caps is incredible, Wunder is amazing as well, just to name the ones that stand out.

nfl,"Will they? I'm not sure. Can they? Definitely. The Vikings promoted Stefanski to OC, brought in Gary Kubiak as a senior offensive advisor, and Rick Dennison as an offensive line coach/""run game coordinator"" to help us run the ball more effectively. Rick Spielman drafted offensive players in the first four rounds, and two of those players are interior offensive lineman. (Bradbury, Samia) Drafting TE Irv Smith Jr. will also result in the Vikings running more 2 TE sets which Kirk Cousins loves and will help keep Laquon Dropwell off the field. They also managed to keep most of their defensive core (Barr, Griffen) with the exception of Sheldon Richardson who was essentially a one year rental anyways.

Knowing the Vikings however, they could very easily dissapoint in a variety of ways. Kirk Cousins may continue to be anti-clutch and manage to piss off Adam Theilen even more than he already has. Our offensive line will most likely still be a work in progress or could even regress depending on how our draft picks and Josh Kline pan out. Maybe the Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak experiment doesn't work out and they end up shitting the bed John Defillippo style. There's also a real chance that the Vikings defense does not return to 2017 form and is nothing more than above average despite most of our players returning. You can also never predict injuries and our season can easily get off track if any member of the o-line goes down or Kirk Cousins considering we have no viable backup options. (Sorry, Kyle Sloter doesn't count.)

I think we're on the right track but it all depends on how certain players perform and what happens next season.",0
movies,"!SPOILERS!

You've conveyed those points really well. Heck, I didn't mind NK not dueling Jon, Arya killing the NK by leaping some 15 feet and I could understand that they did want to try hit and run tactics with the Dothraki charge. Only thing bothering me about the battle layout was the siege engines.

However, as much as the visuals in some scenes got praised, I didn't like the directing. They went for small, momentary shocks for the viewer to basically tell them that the characters are not safe and then just cut into the next scene. 

At first, they show that the first wave of wights is a tsunami and later, there is no clear result of the initial hit. How long and wide was the Unsullied line to take that shock? Where was the pile of those wights if they managed to neutralize that wave? Was Grey Worm in that line and how did he manage to survive? I felt like they thought about adding the tsunami for dramatic effect and then forgot about it.

Jamie, Brien, Pod, Tormund are at the front lines. Although they don't get tsunami'd by the wights, they are still at the front lines facing the full charge of the wights. Heck, even Briene falls down, is bitten and Jaime has to help her. They are struggling. Later on however, all of them are able to move on their own and are able to shout out the retreat in a relatively open space when there is apparently an endless swarm of zombies and all lines (apart from the Unsullied) are probably broken. 

We are repeatedly shown named characters in difficult situations, sometimes being overwhelmed however, in later shots, they are still shown standing. A simple comparison is Jon as soon as NK resurrects the defending forces and the next scene when Dany arrives to clear the path to Winterfell for him. And the problem is key characters are the ones shown standing in the castle, very few hints are given that generic characters are their to support them as well. Doing it the way they did made it very obvious that they are surviving no matter what, which is where I feel like people felt disappointed.

Instead of that, time could have been utilized by (as an example) Tormund and Brienne taking down another giant since they were one of the most capable fighters in the scene. Perhaps, even one of them could have died in that. It would have cemented what Lyanna Mormont pulled off alone that these two could. Or if not that, then having one character group taking on a couple of White Walkers or at least attempt something at them. Having one WW killed could have provided another opportunity where they were going to give the viewers hope but then take it away. 

You could have shown Jaime getting his fake hand pulled off or him using it to create some space like they showed him using it at Dorne. Or Brienne sacrificing herself for Pod and Jaime, since her arc reached her height when she became a knight (currently at least).

Sam should not have survived if he was outside. If they were going to do crypt zombies that were able to grab people through stone, Big Sam would have been a very good option to protect Baby Sam.

Someone else could have baited the Zombie dragon and allowed Jon to enter the tree courtyard, distracting the White Walkers, preparing to take on multiple WWs at once, implying that Jon is going to save the day since he is destined to end it. THEN, you could have shown Arya coming from above to attack the NK, maybe from the tree.


I may be nitpicking here, but I felt like I was watching Zack Snyder doing one of the DC movies. CGI elements interacting with each other for cinematic effect. Some shots, scenery and perspectives were excellent, but I feel like it made many small exceptions along the way which annoyed some people who valued the show for having consequences or no hero to save your favourite character in their time of need.",0

It‚Äôs nice to have someone understand me and say all the things I‚Äôm thinking, without me actually telling you all this.

Except they never release sales numbers except to say 'it sold more than the previous game in the series'.

If a cinema paid Disney so that only they could show End Game, and you were forced to go to 2bit Threatres with no surround sound, grainy film image, metal chairs and no confectionery sold before the film or during it, would you consider that 'not anti consumer'?

I don't think any of my fights have lasted more than two seconds; either I kill the other guy or he kills me. And if you do manage to live more than that while under fire, you won't be able to do anything anyway because the stagger effects with explosive leave you in a constant animation, open for your enemy to finish you off.

leagueoflegends,"&gt; This one is more visually appealing

that's just false. It being ""visually appealing"" has nothing to do with how the system works. You can have mmr/elo visible and basically having the old system but implementing the new tiers and divisions into it. The only thing they are good for is cosmetics anyways.

&gt; more rewarding

it's literally the opposite of rewarding with shit LP gains and many low tier people not even knowing why that is because they simply don't know how the system works. The new system is without a shadow of doubt much worse. No one likes promos nor demotion protection which leads to g5 people actually being s3 or people climbing being p1 while the game shows them as p4. Nothing rewarding or ""nicer looking"" about that.

---

Still before going let's talk about the elephant in the room

&gt; Personally I don't know why some people prefer one system or the other

&gt; This one is more visually appealing, more rewarding and ""nicer"" and also tends to make people look higher (but with low lp gains) which I would say is overall better.

&gt; Yeah, that would be an argument towards current system which I prefer (for that same reason), I meant as in the system itself. Op is saying this would fix the ladder, no it wouldn't.

- remove all reminders of him; gifts, photos from your phone. unfollow him on insta and fb. for a while you'll still look up his profile anyway. but then you won't. 
- see friends and live in the moment; realise you can do pretty much all the fun things you did with him with them instead.
- focus on yourself even more. take up hobbies and work on improving yourself and being happy with your own company 
- whenever he randomly comes to mind, tell yourself 'later'. set aside 10 mins a day to think about/cry over him. when time is up say 'ok it's time to get back to reality'. after a week make it 5 mins a day. then eventually you won't even need the time anymore. all your tears will be done. 
- when you finally aren't thinking about him anymore, your life is busy and full with friends and hobbies, and you love yourself, THEN you can consider dating again. and it won't be painful and you won't compare the new guy to him.

You‚Äôre saying salary level is the measure of class above, yet saying liquid savings is the measure of class here.

Pick one. Regardless of your position, it‚Äôs far more complicated than either measurement. Family size is not the only variable. Debt to income ratio, median family income in the geographic area, as granular as down to the neighborhood, etc, all of these things play a role.

Plainly define what you determine to be the definition of middle class. It‚Äôs not nearly as simple as you think, the mere notion of a middle class is a highly politicized economic principle. 

The two most universally accepted ways to parse the population into classes are income relative to geographic cost of living, in which case I can ASSURE you that a family of four in the Midwest making 90k a year would fall in the middle 33% of income earners and thus be considered middle class, and net worth, which is a little easier to scale nationally as the geographic constraints aren‚Äôt as palpable.",0

relationship_advice,"A lot of good advice in this thread.  Trust, communication, patience, loyalty, listening, time.

It's important that I have my own space and personal time to decompress after work or enjoy my hobbies.  However, one of our key to survive elements of our marriage is that we actually like each other.  I know that sounds silly, so hear me out.  We all know couples show affection to each other, and definitely show their love, but it seems like they don't really like each other or really enjoy each other's company.  I'm no relationship expert, so I'm not qualified to say what sort of dynamic is the best or what is healthy.  Mostly, I know what works in my marriage.

It's important to want to spend time together.  Not obsessively or anything, but you need to have a relationship beyond the romance and sexual aspects.",0

relationship_advice,"Hello, i logged into my account just to add this comment so I hope you find it comforting.   


I really enjoyed your story because it reminded me a lot of my relationship. I am w33d smoker 'Tom' with a girlfriend of 6 years and I would like to share my perspective.   


My GF(24) and I (M23) love eachother but we're also very different. You remind me a lot of my girlfriend, she also tries to be someone and has never supported me for smoking weed, doesn't even want to here the word.  


I have always thought about a life without my girlfriend; secretly attracting a different girl, smoking weed, watching anime and having sex, sounds great.  I have never cheated on my girlfriend and that has never happened, but, I often wonder if that's because I don't want to hurt my girlfriend or because I have never actually had the opportunity.   


Your Tom was given this chance and he choose to peruse it knowing that you wouldn't approve of it. Do I think Tom is a bad guy? No. It's tough being young sexy and settled, are we supposed to know what want we want from life? If I did what Tom did, I don't think I would be able tell my girlfriend, It would tear me apart. I have never wanted to hurt my girlfriend but I sure do dream about enjoying time with someone else.  


Relationships and people are tough, confusing and troublesome. Whatever you choose to do just make sure you don't leave with any regrets. I know you may think I may love my GF more than Tom ever loved you, but as I said, it's all down to someones options. Hear him out and make up your mind, don't be stuck in this zone forever.",0

Market76,"Well then AAE is not useful in the slightest for pve, as most enemies have natural resistances not armour so AA is stupid, FE is also fairly stupid the Explosive often screws up the damage multiplier of Furious since the explosive hits other enemies. TSE is outdated but would be alright particularly for a shotgun build sicne you wouldn‚Äôt be worried about accuracy their not expensive either. BE would be your top tier particularly if your a low health build or even run half health. BE is also great in pvp,  IE has the same sorta thing as FE. IMO both IE and FE are stupid, IE is stupid because when you shoot into a hoard you deal double damage the bullet damage to the target you hit but you also apply 2x to the explosion it creates, thus ruining you getting that large chunk on all the other enemies as they‚Äôve been damaged by a Explosion doing 10 damage. FE I already explained why it‚Äôs not the best, like it‚Äôs good I sure like it but the amount of times something has stopped me from hitting insane damage with it through the furious effect is unbelievable",0

No.

Yes. 

IMO, this is a double standard (ish?). Girls turn down sex on first date: *I am a women, i choose when we have sex. All guys want is sex. UGH.* Guys turn down sex on first date: *Who does he think he is for not wanting me?!  Am i ugly?*  

Sex or no sex on the first date doesn't matter to me.  It won't make me judge a man to be more or less of a man.  I believe sex happens when both are ready.  Some are ready date 1 and some are ready date 50 and some are ready after marriage.

None?Why tf did you let me unloch them?
When will I use these?? 
Good amount of moves but bad organization of the utility.

Fatalities/Brutalities: 6                 
2 are few.
For Brutalities I am quite enraged,since most of them depending on moves that I can t equip in ranked what tf is this shi‚Äù‚Äùy choice?!?
Btw I love brutalities and I love they fished some old fatality for these.

Stages:9.5    WOW. What a wonderful work. I love all of them,interactives are great.

Endings:?    Donno,have over 30 hours but only Scorpion has cut the rope so I can‚Äôt say much.

At the very least if you're not going to present crazy ones in the story and not defaultable selectable in tournaments, at least let the consumers choose to use them in their own modes if they want too.   [Let me run with this as sonya online.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sYVCkxkHIWE/maxresdefault.jpg)

To me this title could just say the other way if they got rid of fatalities.  If you're just all about the violence then you're virgin children.

Hate to tell you but the only way this ends with you keeping your family is if you tell her 1- you are seeing a lawyer and filing immediately, that she will get the divorce papers in a week. Tell her you will not share your wife under any circumstances and will not tolerate this.

2 - you are moving out, so tell her you want her to be there when you tell the kids you are moving out  and explain why. Find an air bnb or a short lease (dont tell her how long)

3 - she quits her job. No complaints. She shares her location with you so you can make sure she is not parked up with this guy and agrees to give you access to whatever you like password wise.

4 - you go knock on his family's door. At night while he is there and speak to him. Look him in the eye and tell him you are filing for divorce, you will be informing his employers and making it public, you will be letting his family know he is a marriage wrecker ... tell him he is welcome to your wife but he had better be prepared for the consequences

Showerthoughts,"If you one tax bracket of 10% from $0-50,000, and a second tax bracket of 20% for $50,001+, then if you make $100,000, the first half is taxed at 10%, and the second half at 20%. The average tax rate would be 15%, not 20%, since: 

* 10% * 50,000 + 20% * 50,000 = 15,000 / 100,000 = 15%

Only the money that specifically falls into a tax bracket is taxed at that rate. If you get a raise, even if it pushes you into the next tax bracket, you will never earn less money. However, you can lose certain benefits, but any significant ones that I am aware of are staggered so that they also work similarly.

Regardless, no tax bracket in Canada exists that is anywhere close to 70%, so no matter what, no average tax rate would even be able to approach that number.",0

MortalKombat,"I believe any kombo can be cut short with a cancel into a special move. For example a 1,2,3 combo. Just don't hit 3 and hit b,f,1 instead to end the string with a special.

The trick is knowing how to follow up after that. A lot of amplified special moves involve a popup or combo extending delay of some sort. So you could do 1,2,bf1+amplify then do 1,2,3.

You'll get the hang of it if you just mess around in practice mode.

As for character recommendations, just pick someone whose moves seem cool to you. Even the complicated characters are relatively easy if you don't delve too deep into their fancy stuff. Then you can just save the fancy stuff for once you're a better player.

For example, I started as Baraka. Dude is pretty simple. Just rush in and stab and slash. Then i gave Cetrion a shot, and she has a lot more tools at her disposal but requires some more strategy than just ""run in and hit square"". That said, she does have 3 very easy combo strings. and if i brain fart in the middle of combat, i just hit one of them.

Also don't worry about who's good and who's bad, tier lists only hold weight for higher end players. If you just want to casually go up against randoms, every character is viable. Just have fun with it!",0

There are only 2 ways of making him playable in solo Q:

1. Buff his stats. I know, this is the most stupid way to do it, but it's also the simplier.
2. Give him a normal kit that doesn't revolve around his W. Keep the current version of his W, perhaps even nerf it. Rework his passive(you don't need on hit dmg for a tank support) , but still keep his mark to empower q and w, perhaps in a different form. And rework that shield.

relationship_advice,"&gt;I feel like if you save porn it‚Äôs more... intimate? It becomes more than just something to masturbate to. There‚Äôs so much porn out there so why feel the need to rewatch one video constantly?

It's not more intimate, it's still just porn and just because it's in the hard drive it doesn't mean you'll rewatch it constantly.

Sometimes the internet fails. Sometimes you just find something you like and don't want to spend time searching for it again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And why is that a video of a singular girl masturbating in front of you?

Because he doesn't want a dude's penis and ass taking screen space? Because this particular girl has specifically shaped boobs/ass/thigh/ankles/toenails/whatever that he likes and she doesn't do m/f porn?

So many possible reasons and none of it really matters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No. I‚Äôm ok  with couples porn. I‚Äôm not ok with someone else masturbating in front of  my bf and talking to him as they do it, no matter who it is. I‚Äôm  allowed to have that boundary. Don‚Äôt try belittle me for that.

You're allowed to demand all boundaries you want. Your SO is just not obligated to follow all your boundaries. Especially those involving what he does when he's alone.

So unless he's watching this kind of porn in front of you, you have no business policing what he watches.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I  know he‚Äôs not guilty for it I never said he was I just said it brought  back the same types of feelings and fear that it would happen again.

You know he's not guilty but it sure looks like he's taking the fall for what the other guy did.",0

todayilearned,"&gt; So black people who move from the Carribean aren't allowed to have black pride? 

It's a completely differen't culture. Fuck your loaded 'allowed' term, it's just not how they'd partake. That being said, racism isn't all gone yet, not even on an institutional level, so they might find reason to understand. 

&gt;Black people in Africa aren't allowed to have black pride?

It's a fucking different world there. 'Black pride' isn't a thing because they're a majority, if anything their pride is national, familial, or sometimes 'ethno-tribal'. You'll find Eritreans and Somalians or Somalians and Ethiopians that can't stand each other on a racial perspective. It's just taking the context out.

Hell, even in Europe the idea of 'black pride' is only borrowed from American lexicon because it means something different. There aren't 'black pride' movements but minorities will still be looking for rights or more recognition, or react to animosity/hostility when faced with it.  It's just a completely different thing that doesn't coem into it.

We're *very* specifically talking about the US context. That being said, 'white pride' makes no fucking sense in Europe either. 

&gt;It's almost like you've pointed out that the common use of white has evolved to encompass people of white skin, and their respective heritages.

And part of that heritage is how 'not-white-enough' whites weren't white. It's self defeating because the only unifying thing among them is *not black*. That's the fucking perverted part you don't seem to find gross, which is what I'm finding gross about you as a white(?), European Catholic. 

&gt;No, because I'm not selectively bouncing back and forth between language and its use a hundred years ago and current day and selectively applying it to suit my argument because I'm not suffering from delusional levels of cognitive dissonance.

The *reason* that old usages matter is because we're discussing heritage. Part of your heritage is that you *weren't* seen as 'white' and you want to *celebrate it*. That's insane, frankly, and a much better candidate for causing cognitive dissonance, if you'd ask me. 

&gt;Cognitive. Dissonance.
&gt;
&gt;Its amazing that in a single sentence you can point out areas of persecution and how society as a whole collectively changed for the better and in the same breath say ""there was no struggle"".
&gt;
&gt;Amazing, honestly.

What's amazing is you *still* cannot see the difference between something like *Irish* pride, because you were othered at a point even if you're in good social standing today and how it's opposed to *white* pride which only means sense if it means ""proud I'm not not-white"".  What Irish pride is for white pride cannot also be for.

I cannot fathom it. Society as a whole being better wasn't the result of *white fucking pride* or *white* efforts. That's why it makes even less sense. What's white pride for in this case? ""We managed to give some rights to black people, and now we call Irish people white, because, hey, at least they ain't black. Let's pat ourselves on the back!""",0

Showerthoughts,"&gt;The middle class is comprised of doctors, lawyers, and managers -- $90k a year is where the low end starts.

$90k a year is not lower middle class, or anywhere near the border. It is squarely in the middle of the income range:
&gt;Middle-income households ‚Äì those with an income that is two-thirds to double the U.S. median household income ‚Äì had incomes ranging from about [$45,200 to $135,600 in 2016.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/06/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/)

You don't just get to arbitrarily decide where the middle class income cutoff line is. 
&gt;Unfortunately, the american working class seems to have a very warped view of what constitutes middle class, and overestimates its position as a result.

In my opinion, and the opinion of the vast majority of others, yours is the view that is warped. 

&gt;The middle class doesn't refer to the average or median income, it refers to the middle class -- that being the middle point between those that don't have to work and those that struggle to get by.

The upper class does not mean ""those that don't have to work"", that is the ultra-rich *capitalist* class. The vast majority of upper class people in America work for a living. They just happen to have very good jobs or profitable businesses. 

&gt;The upper class is the portion of the population that doesn't have to work, the working class is the portion of the population that has to work and experiences financial stress, and the middle class is the in-between, the portion that has to work, but doesn't experience financial stress.

Your definitions are terrible. Lots of rich people experience financial stress, and lots of poor people do not. When I was a student, I was indisputably poor, and yet I experienced no financial distress.

I also think you are using the archaic 1800s term ""bourgeoisie"" as your proxy for what you think the modern ""middle class"" is. Back in the 1800s, the bourgeoisie was considered to be the ""middle class"", and it was comprised of high-end professionals like doctors, lawyers, bankers, etc. They were very affluent, but not enough to be the aristocracy. 

The old paradigm of aristocracy - bourgeoisie - peasantry is obsolete. You are trying to apply it to modern society when society has moved on from that paradigm a long, long time ago.",0

relationship_advice,"I think he lied to you because it's honestly embarrassing when your girlfriend finds old (or new) porn on your computer. I think you should be clear and explain why it makes you uncomfortable. 

As you stated, watching porn is quite a common phenomenon, would you feel different if it was lesbian porn? It may also have not been a cam girl but just a solo masturbation video. There's obviously an appealing side to watching a female pleasure herself, unlike watching some dude ramming his junk into someone. 

I think you aren't over-reacting, its valid. But I don't think its fair to bring your old feelings of insecurity onto this issue. You can't hold you current boyfriend to you horrible ex's. If you do that its not really fair. 

To sum it up, people watch porn, probably lied to you because he was embarrassed/scared, not an issue, maybe just make it clear that him watching porn makes you uncomfortable.",0

But essentially it's like making a couple thousand extra a month at least after paying bills, putting away to a savings fund, giving your children pocket money, paying for their schools and other necessities. It's when you have enough extra on top of the extra that you put away into savings for you to think ""it would be no biggie if I went to this restaurant and spent 200$ today"" instead of thinking ""this money could serve me better if I put it away for some other purpose"".

MortalKombat,"Yo nice, I also play a ton of Jade so I understand your frustration when playing against noob. I guess I'll start at the top and work down.


Kung Lao's tele is interesting because he has three threatening options off of it. Thankfully a jab (1, square on ps4, X on Xbox) beats every option if you throw it out as he's rising from the teleport. Other options include ducking if you think he's going to throw or use his hat swipe and countering with an uppercut when he misses or baiting him into using his overhead option and taking advantage of the fact that it's minus on block. If Kung Lao teleports into his wutang spin, blocking it will give you the advantage and you can punish with your 1,2 string (high, low). The only thing he can do in that situation is guard. 


Recognizing jump-ins is incredibly important in any fighting game and there really isn't a quick solution to getting better at it other than practicing. That said, your opponent is the most vulnerable when they're in the air. In MK11 you can anti-air with literally any button provided you recognize the jump fast enough, and even convert into decent damage with Jade's multi-hitting combo enders. There's a reason why anyone who plays street fighter at a decent level knows the strongest piece of advice is ""don't jump"". MK isn't so much different now. 


Noob is a bit tricky as he has a lot of weird moves that, as you said, are unpredictable in their range. I don't understand what you mean when you say the 'option select' is inevitable, but there are ways to deal with a noob player. First off, he can't really challenge the range on Jade's normals with anything other than his forward 4 (it looks like a slide forward and then a mid kick). This is an extremely unsafe move for noob and can easily be punished by blocking the first hit low, then punishing with pretty much anything you want. Remember also that Noob has horrible projectiles. They move slowly and take forever to cross the screen so you can just zone him out. Most noobs will then start trying to catch you with a teleport. Unfortunately for noob, his tele hits high. So as long as you're either blocking or ducking you can get a full punish on him with practically any combo you know. A blocked teleslam from noob puts you at a mind shattering +29!!! That's half a second of frame advantage!


Sub-Zero (and scorpion to a lesser extent) is an interesting problem for Jade. As a Jade player I feel that I really have a lot of control over the neutral game. So when the opponent has a move like Sub-Zero's slide, a move that completely negates any footsies whatsoever, I feel at a disadvantage. The best way to deal with him is to just be patient. Blocking the slide guarantees you a free punish combo since it puts him at a staggering -20 so your game plan should be to frustrate him into using the slide to get in. In order to do that you just need to be able to block his strings and respond with safe strings of your own. Forward 3,4,3 (edenian rush) leaves you at -6 which means it's safe while back 3,4,3,4 (fatal attraction) actually leaves you at +5 meaning that you can keep putting pressure on him even if he blocks it. My go to bait is to either edenian rush or fatal attraction, then block low in case of the slide retaliation. Another thing to look out for is that a lot of sub zeros like to start their strings with back 1. This move hits high so you can just duck under it and counter. 


I don't have much experience against Erron Blacks but I find that most of them want to be within throw range of you so that they can force you to stand on the puddle of goo they throw out. My go-to strategy for dealing with them is pretty much the same as dealing with sub zero. Just outplay them in the neutral using your range and safe strings, play patiently,  and wait for them to get frustrated and throw out a raw slide. As Jade your normals are better ranged which means that you can completely control the pace of the match. Remember that you can use Forward 4 and short hops to jump over low attacks!",0

ChapoTrapHouse,"&gt;Oh, so now I'm a liar

Well you're lying, so yes, you are.

&gt;I've done nothing but tell the truth as I see it

So, as you see it, 40 plus days is a *shorter* timeframe than 24-48 hours? This is what you're actually expecting us to accept?

&gt;Yes, and I told the person (or rather, troll, since that what they were doing at the time) 


Nope. Frankly, with the shit you're coming out with, you sound like a fucking troll. Do you legitimately think simply commenting on a public sub qualifies as trolling? 

&gt;that I would look into it via PM (which I provided proof of). Unfortunately, as I stated earlier (though to your credit, it may have been to someone else in this thread that I said this too) my father died so I dropped off of reddit for a few weeks. When I came back, I had nearly forgotten about it. Did I drop the ball? Maybe. But he's gone now. Problem solved. Did feet get dragged? Possibly, but if it was the case, it wasn't intentional. 

Mate, seriously, do you legit think we can't follow the conversation or what? You chose to do nothing. You saying you offered to do something via PM means nothing when you didn't actually fucking do it. Your dad dying has nothing to do with anything, it wasn't involved in your decision at all. It didn't afgect anything. You did nothing, your dad died, you continued to do nothing.

&gt;As I've shown earlier, I've removed racist mods from my mod team before. Why would I not remove Manbra if that was the case?

You tell us. 

&gt;Two things. First, ""reddit mods"" covers thousands, if not tens of thousands of people. 

Not when it comes to defaults. 

&gt;Treating mods as one monolithic group is not just inaccurate, it's ignorant. Second, believe it or not, most mods aren't covering for each other. I've yet to see that happen in any subs I've been moderating and I've been here a long time. 

Well we've already established you're massively incompetent so I don't really give much weight to that statement. I've seen that happen in 95 percent of the subs i've reported shit in. 

&gt;is usually not wanting to step on another mod's toes without good reason

The problem is spineless fucks like you don't consider ""is a clear and obvious white supremacist"" 'good reason'. 

&gt;So now who's lying? 

Still you mate, I mean I would say nice try but it wasn't even, that was just pathetic. Stop calling it a fucking witch hunt. Stop saying 'dragging' like it's some horrendous incursion on youe fucking sports sub. The language you use to describe this whole thing is fucking embarassing. 

&gt;Rather than PM me, or send a modmail to the entire rest of the mod team

You mean mod mail that could be seen and ignored by the fucking guy we're talking about, yeah, genius mate. I reported that guy before, you did fuck all. And again, why should I trust you to do anything via PM? Why does the conversation need to be private? 

&gt;They wanted outrage, they wanted pitchforks and people screaming for his head. Well they got it, he received death threats. I don't care how racist someone is, nobody deserves death threats.

Lol, you literally had the opportunity to fix the problem without things getting to that stage and you stuck your head in the sand. They wanted a white supremacist taien off of the mod team of a fucking default with millions of subscribers. Love how you STILL want to make this all about how poor manbra is a victim in all of this as well. Fuck you.

&gt;I should have ended the conversation a long time ago. I'm discussing this with a child who need to resort to insults and cursing. Sorry, but I prefer my discussions, debates &amp; even arguments to be, at bare minimum, civil

Showerthoughts,"It is on paper but what you earn could go to any number of things like rent, food etc. that are more necessary things. So earning 100 is really like earning less once all that stuff is paid. Then someone spends 100, probably on something more luxuriant, well. Assuming you are paying everything off you might take a few paychecks to save up that much. That's not spending beyond your means, it would just contrast your earnings because what you actually keep for 'luxury' purchases after paying utilities and all is absolutely not $100.",0

Ok on the first point I, of course,  agree that they should discuss it my only point is that they are not married so its really his business in that regard. Should they discuss it though? Absolutely ( agreeing with you ) 
There is no differnce regarding intent if its a turkey baster or not I was thinking its not very safe ( yucky )
Whats abortion got to do with this? Nothing apart from the way I have been yelled at by feminists for daring to have an opinion as its a ""womans issue"" / ""her body"" etc etc.. I may have been a little triggered there ( apologies )
